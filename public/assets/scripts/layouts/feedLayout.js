{'site_name': 'Foreign Affairs', 'author': 'Steven A', 'text': 'What does it mean to be Chinese? A strong tradition in premodern China held that it meant thinking, behaving, and living in a society in accord with heaven-sanctioned principles exemplifying the best way to be human. Other peoples could learn this Chineseness, and they could also become civilized, but they could never rival China in either defining propriety or drawing people into accordance with it.  For centuries, this way of thinking went largely unchallenged, and even today, its fundamental assumptions run deep. To be Chinese still means to exhibit proper behavior and to be part of a civilization that has primacy in the world. Most modern Chinese would accept this, at least tacitly. Where they would disagree often sharply is over just what values Chineseness should stand for today. Is the moral model of premodern times still relevant in the modern political context, or should it be displaced by newer ideas of political morality? Chinese President Xi Jinping s  Chinese dream  is best understood as a backward-looking answer to the question. But in spite of his wishes, the debate will continue, and it could contribute to instability and even violence in the coming decades.  Reuters / Kim Kyung-Hoon A man talks on an iPhone in Beijing, July 2013. version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"??  OLD SCHOOL  Traditional Chinese family values, often called  Confucian,  were deeply ethical, although not egalitarian. A father had authority over a son, and the son was bound to obey. But the father was bound, too: he had to be a proper father, treating his son as a father should, and could be held up to public scorn if he did not.  Political norms were based on the family model. A ruler had absolute authority over his subjects but was morally bound to treat them properly. If he did not, they could flee or rebel, and the ruler might lose his  heavenly mandate  to rule. And how could rulers learn what proper treatment of subjects was? By reading and internalizing texts. Officials at all levels were chosen through examinations in the Confucian classics, the memorization of which was thought to instill a morality that equipped them to be proper leaders.  The term  Chinese  implicitly meant  Han,  referring to China s dominant ethnicity. Over the last century, both nationalist and communist governments have tried to counter this ethnocentricity, embracing a definition of  national citizen  that included non-Han peoples as well. This system worked, but not always well. Sometimes the exams were corrupted, and sometimes the world of officialdom amounted to little more than routinized bribery flaws that were clearly in evidence during the mid-nineteenth century. But even with the system at a low point, assumptions about how it was supposed to work held strong. The legitimacy of officials was supposed to be based on their morality, with virtue increasing all the way up the chain to the emperor the  son of heaven,  whose only superior was nature itself. Non-Chinese peoples who fell outside this system, meanwhile, were considered ethically inferior; their role was to pay tribute to, and learn from, the center.  The term  Chinese  implicitly meant  Han,  referring to China s dominant ethnicity. Over the last century, both nationalist and communist governments have tried to counter this ethnocentricity, embracing a definition of  national citizen  that included non-Han peoples as well. This new usage gained some traction at official levels, but in daily life,  Chinese  has continued to be understood, implicitly, as Han. A Han family living in Singapore or San Francisco, for example, is regarded as huaqiao meaning  Chinese abroad even after several generations, but nobody would think to use that term to refer to a Uighur from Xinjiang who has moved to Samarkand, in Uzbekistan. In the unlikely event that a Caucasian baby were adopted by Chinese parents and raised in China, the child would not easily be thought of by locals as Chinese. But a Han baby adopted and raised in the United States is normally regarded by both Chinese and American communities as  one of us.   Throughout most of China s history, the traditional moral-political model was able to withstand or absorb outside influences. Buddhism came from India, Mongol and Manchu invaders swept in from inner Asia, and traders from the Near East arrived along the Silk Road and by sea, but the system held fast. Chineseness was too powerful to be dislodged; it was the invaders who adapted.  The city wall in Beijing, after its capture by the English and French armies on October 21, 1860. version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"??  One of the first responses by the Chinese to the British cannons was to upgrade their own. But to do that, China needed Western science, and to get that, it needed Western schooling which meant learning Western languages and traveling abroad. This seemed a slippery slope; the core of Chineseness might fade away. Some Chinese thinkers in the early twentieth century went so far as to call for scrapping the traditional model and opting for all-out westernization. But most stopped short of that. Mao Zedong, for one, used the slogan  foreign things for China s use with China, by implication, retaining its core identity.  Meanwhile, the modern world kept coming: electricity, textile mills, rail and air travel, finance, diplomacy, computers, the Internet, and more. China did not really have a choice about whether to let these things in, even though some of them undermined established patterns. Having to pay lip service to words such as  democracy  while continuing to resist what they actually meant led to hypocrisy. Mao called his rule a  people s democratic dictatorship  and claimed that it was administered through  democratic centralism.   Reuters / Carlos Barria In front of the Great Hall of the People at Beijing, November 2012. version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?? Such language was an attempt to continue the traditional authoritarian model under a fashionable modern label. But other Chinese took the new words and concepts at face value. Early-twentieth-century thinkers, such as Hu Shih and Luo Longji, embraced Western notions of democracy and citizen rights, as did more recent figures, such as the late astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo.  Ordinary Chinese people, too, have moved in this direction; the notion that everyone has rights has spread widely in recent decades. In Mao s time, simply pronouncing the phrase  people s rights  in public was dangerous; today, even farmers in small towns organize to assert their rights. The change has been gradual, but it is real.  BACK TO THE FUTURE?  In recent decades, Chinese Communist Party leaders have tried to revive the traditional moral-political model with certain modern adaptations. Xi s  Chinese dream,  for example, emphasizes wealth, national pride, and obedience to authority. Media and schools stress the idea of patriotism, with  love of country  considered conterminous with  love of the Communist Party.  Ideas such as democracy, human rights, and modernization are mentioned as well, but generally with the appendage  with Chinese characteristics,  to indicate that they have been modified to fit into Communist Party authoritarianism. And a  Chinese model  of development supposedly offers other countries an example of an authoritarian route to wealth and power.  Underlying all these developments is a vision of China returning to its place at the center of the world, serving as the defining example of how things should be. Yet this vision remains a mere possibility, not a certainty, because strong currents in Chinese society run against it. Foremost among them is the popular perception that the prevailing system benefits a privileged elite more than the nation as a whole.  Underlying all these developments is a vision of China returning to its place at the center of the world, serving as the defining example of how things should be. The gap between rich and poor in China has grown immensely in recent years, and common people often feel that the wealth of the politically connected elite has been won through graft, repression, and private connections more than hard work and enterprise. Ordinary people see their land confiscated and their savings depleted, and those who resist are bullied by hired thugs. The Internet has made it difficult to keep events of this kind secret, and popular resentment has led to protests, including strikes, demonstrations, and road blockades. Hundreds of them occur every day, forcing Beijing to spend scores of billions of dollars annually on  stability maintenance a euphemism for  domestic security.   On the Internet, meanwhile, there have been recent signs that some Chinese have been moving away from equating the country with the Communist Party. Because Internet censors use filters to track the use of sensitive words such as  government,  regular Internet users have invented sly substitutes. Standard work-arounds for references to China s rulers have included terms such as  heavenly dynasty  and even  western Korea meaning  western North Korea.  Forty years ago, such sarcasm was unthinkable. Twenty years ago, it was rare. Today, it suggests the emergence of new grounds for conceiving of national identity, based on something other than identification with the party.  Xi s  Chinese dream  stresses party-loving patriotism and materialism, but it does not say anything about the moral treatment of fellow human beings in daily life. This is a major weakness, given the heavy emphasis that Confucian tradition puts on interpersonal ethics. No dream about what it means to be Chinese in the twenty-first century can feel right in Chinese culture if it omits all mention of moral behavior. Democracy advocates who speak of  rights  and  dignity  may be using foreign terms, but they are also answering a very traditional Chinese question about how people should relate to one another.  China s rulers surely recognize the lacuna in their dream, but they fear the concept of citizenship because it gives the populace too much autonomy. They want followers, not citizens. China s rulers surely recognize the lacuna in their dream, but they fear the concept of citizenship because it gives the populace too much autonomy. They want followers, not citizens. This is why they spend so much effort and money pushing the ideas of materialism and state strength, whose shallow appeal has had considerable success. Many Chinese, especially the urban young, have bought into the notion that being Chinese in the twenty-first century means being materialistic, nationalist, and aggressive. Whereas Chinese students of a generation ago admired Western life and values so much that they built a statue, Goddess of Democracy, on Tiananmen Square, today, after decades of government-sponsored anti-Western indoctrination, many see the West more as a hostile rival than as a friend.  LUMPERS AND SPLITTERS  Beijing s massive domestic security efforts are geared primarily toward keeping a lid on protests by China s lower classes. But not all sources of contemporary instability are rooted in economic inequality. Power rivalry within the elite, for example, is a perennial concern. Recent factional squabbling has occurred among the so-called princelings (children of prominent revolutionaries), the Youth League faction (allies of former President Hu Jintao), and the Shanghai Gang (associates of former President Jiang Zemin).  Reuters / Stringer An army officer and tourist guides in Fujian province, December 2013. version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"??  Strife among competing factions of the elite differs from friction between the elite and the underclass, but the two levels of conflict can align when members of the elite see opportunities to manipulate popular discontent to their advantage. This occurred in 2009 11, for example, when the Chongqing-based princeling Bo Xilai exploited widespread anger over corruption in order to build support for his attempt to jump ahead of his rival princeling Xi and position himself as the country s next leader. Bo s gambit failed: he now sits in prison. Meanwhile, having ascended to the top himself, Xi is using an anticorruption campaign in part to fuel his own popularity and bring down rivals.  One sign of insecurity within the elite is the eagerness of many to send wealth and family abroad. Many rich Chinese have emigrated in recent years or have at least taken steps to make their future emigration easier; Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and the United States are favorite destinations. The number of Chinese students from prominent families sent to school in the West has risen sharply, as have private Chinese real estate investments in North America. And residents of Hong Kong have complained that maternity wards in local hospitals have become overcrowded because mainland Chinese women come to give birth there, so as to ensure that their babies receive automatic local residency rights.  China has many strong regional identities in Guangdong, Sichuan, the Northeast, and elsewhere and patterns of talking back to Beijing, or pretending to obey while in fact going one s own way, have played out for decades. China s military bureaucracy is less transparent than its civilian counterpart, but it appears to be just as fraught with corruption and internal rivalries. The danger of military disobedience is indirectly suggested by warnings from civilian leaders (including Xi) against any such actions.  China has many strong regional identities in Guangdong, Sichuan, the Northeast, and elsewhere and patterns of talking back to Beijing, or pretending to obey while in fact going one s own way, have played out for decades. Yet residents of these regions would have no hesitation in identifying themselves as Chinese; their local actions pose little threat to national unity or the stability of communist rule. The Chinese heartland, therefore, is not in danger of falling apart. But the demands for autonomy by Tibetans, Uighurs, and the residents of Hong Kong and Taiwan do represent a challenge to the official conception of national identity.  For Tibetans and Uighurs, the desire for self-rule is rooted primarily in differences of ethnicity, language, culture, and religion. For Han Chinese living in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the impulse emerges from the past century s history and politics, which have given them a sense of independent identity. Since party ideology holds that minorities are treated equally and love the motherland, secessionist longings by Tibetans and Uighurs embarrass the authorities in Beijing and pose a threat to their claims of legitimacy. The economic and social success of Hong Kong and Taiwan pose a different sort of threat by making clear, contrary to Beijing s official line, that Western-style democracy can work just fine with Chinese citizens.  Beijing s response to all four cases has been the same, essentially declaring that each area is part of China whether its residents desire it or not. Communist Party leaders have used all four to stimulate nationalist sentiment within the Chinese heartland and to position themselves as guardians of national pride. To hear party officials tell it, the otherwise diverse figures of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, the former Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian, and the Hong Kong student activist Joshua Wong have one trait in common: their desire to  split the motherland.   MAO BETTER BLUES  The popular Western view of China as a self-confidently rising power is dangerously superficial. The country is certainly wealthier than it was four decades ago, and its military, diplomatic stature, and international economic presence are all much stronger. Living standards have improved, and hundreds of millions of Chinese have moved out of poverty through their own hard work. Beneath the surface, however, insecurity is widespread among everyone from rural farmers to members of the privileged urban class. People fear tainted food, water, and air, and rampant corruption and chicanery sour the public mood and erode trust. The spread of the Internet and the readiness of ordinary people to assert their rights have made it far harder for the government to keep society in line today than during Mao s regime two generations back.  Reuters / Kim Kyung-Hoon Souvenirs for sale in Beijing, March 2015. version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"??  Hu, who stepped down as the top leader in 2012, seemed to spend the last few months of his term running out the clock. His successor, Xi, took office knowing that China faced a crisis and that he had to try something different. His response, however, has been to fall back on the familiar revolutionary ideas of his parents  generation. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was Mao s confederate in the 1940s and 1950s. He strongly believed that a Spartan, uncorrupt Communist Party organized under a unified command could  serve the people  (in the words of the then-common slogan) and could bring them happiness. Mao later persecuted Xi senior, and the Maoist project failed in spectacular ways. Xi junior observed those failures, but he has nevertheless started to head down a similar path. Since 2012, he has sought to fashion himself as a repeat of Mao centralizing power, launching anticorruption drives, targeting rivals, and even suggesting a move toward a cult of personality.', 'title': 'What It Means to Be Chinese', 'date': '2015-04-20 00:00:00', 'path': 'https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-04-20/what-it-means-be-chinese', 'top_image': 'https://files.foreignaffairs.com/styles/large-crop-landscape/s3/legacy/images/8_Link.jpg?itok=sZPyWnn4'},
{'site_name': 'fox13now.com', 'author': 'Cnn Wire', 'text': '  New Year, new laws: Obamacare, pot, guns and drones  By Leigh Ann Caldwell  WASHINGTON (CNN)   Not everyone subscribes to a New Year s resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014.  Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.  Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.  Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines  The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.  For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.  The Obamacare, of Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care.  Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1.  Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.  Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins  Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered.  Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.  California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement.  Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.  Illinois and drones  Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its  air angels  effort to protect against  cruel  and  illegal  hunting.  Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant.  Gender and voting identity  California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams  consistent with their gender identity,  even if it s different than their gender at birth.  Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth.  Minimum wage and former felon employment  Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage.  While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey, and Connecticut.  New Jersey residents voted to raise the state s minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.  California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.  Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application.  Social media and pot  Oregon: Employers and schools can t require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.  Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary.

{'site_name': 'The New Yorker', 'author': '', 'text': 'In her diary, Godelieva De Troyer classified her moods by color. She felt  dark gray  when she made a mistake while sewing or cooking. When her boyfriend talked too much, she moved between  very black  and  black!  She was afflicted with the worst kind of  black spot  when she visited her parents at their farm in northern Belgium. In their presence, she felt aggressive and dangerous. She worried that she had two selves, one  empathetic, charming, sensible  and the other cruel.  She felt  light gray  when she went to the hairdresser or rode her bicycle through the woods in Hasselt, a small city in the Flemish region of Belgium, where she lived. At these moments, she wrote, she tried to remind herself of all the things she could do to feel happy:  demand respect from others ;  be physically attractive ;  take a reserved stance ;  live in harmony with nature.  She imagined a life in which she was intellectually appreciated, socially engaged, fluent in English (she was taking a class), and had a  cleaning lady with whom I get along very well.   Godelieva, who taught anatomy to nurses, had been in therapy since she was nineteen. With each new doctor, she embraced the therapeutic process anew, adopting her doctor s philosophy and rewriting her life story so that it fit his theory of the mind. She continually dissected the source of her distress.  I am confronted almost daily with the consequences of my childhood,  she wrote to her mother. She d wanted to be a historian, but her father, domineering and cold, had pressured her to be a doctor. Her mother, who was unhappy in her marriage, reminded her of a  slave.   New insight,  she wrote in her diary.  Do not want to always nod yes like her and be self-effacing.   Godelieva was preoccupied with the idea that she would replicate her parents  mistakes with her own children. She married when she was twenty-three, and had two children. But the marriage was tumultuous and ended in divorce, in 1979, when her son was three and her daughter was seven. Two years later, their father, Hendrik Mortier, a radiologist, committed suicide. As a single parent, Godelieva was overwhelmed. In a diary entry from 1990, when her children were teen-agers, she instructed herself to  let my children be themselves, respect them in their individuality.  But she found herself fighting with her daughter, who was independent and emotionally distant, and depending on her son, Tom, a  victim of my instability,  she wrote. She worried, she told her psychologist, that her children were  now paying for all that has happened generations earlier.   The happiest time in Godelieva s life began when she was in her early fifties and had a new boyfriend. She felt as if she had finally moved beyond the dramas of her childhood, an achievement for which she credited her new psychiatrist.  He opens the wound completely, cleans it thoroughly and closes it so it can heal,  she wrote to a friend. Godelieva, who had blond hair and a wistful smile, made many friends during these years.  She was the most beautiful woman,  Tom told me.  People would say to me,  Oh, I could fall in love with your mother.    Christiane Geuens, a close friend, said,  People always wanted to know her. When she walked into a room, everyone knew.   Godelieva was delighted when Tom and his wife had a child, in 2005. She promised that she would make up for her failures as a mother by being an attentive grandmother. In photographs, she is physically affectionate with Tom s daughter, holding her as she brushes her teeth, or sitting on the bed with her, braiding her hair.  Then, in 2010, her boyfriend broke up with her, and she felt black again. She stopped wearing makeup and doing her hair, and she cancelled dates with friends, she said, because she felt ugly and old. She felt that she had lost her levensperspectief, a Dutch word that refers to the sense that there is something to live for. Tom was only thirty minutes away, but she no longer had the energy to drive to his house. She accused Tom of being insufficiently sympathetic, and Tom, who had just had a second child, blamed her for abandoning him and his family. After several months of fights, they stopped speaking. In her diary, she wrote,  I don t think there can be fruitful contact with the children with all his aggression toward me.  Tom s sister, a lawyer who does human-rights work in Africa, also avoided her; she found it too painful to be sucked back into her mother s depression, which had dominated her childhood. (She has asked not to be named.)  Godelieva felt as if her emotional progress had been an illusion. She had seen the same psychiatrist for more than ten years and had consulted him on every decision, even those involving financial investments and home renovations, but she had now lost faith in his judgment. She complained to friends,  I give him ninety euros, he gives me a prescription, and after ten minutes it s over.  Her psychiatrist acknowledged that there was no cure for her condition; the best he could do, he said, was listen to her and prescribe antidepressants, as he had been doing for years.  In the summer of 2011, when she was sixty-three, Godelieva met a new doctor. She attended a lecture by Wim Distelmans, an oncologist and a professor of palliative medicine at the Free University of Brussels. Distelmans was one of the leading proponents of a 2002 law in Belgium that permits euthanasia for patients who have an incurable illness that causes them unbearable physical or mental suffering. Since then, he has euthanized more than a hundred patients. Distelmans, who wears leather coats and boots and artfully tossed scarves, has become a celebrity in Belgium for promoting a dignified death as a human right, a  tremendous liberation,  and he gives talks at cultural centers, hospitals, and schools around the country.  In September, 2011, Godelieva saw Distelmans at his clinic. Four months later, she sent an e-mail to her children:  I have filed a euthanasia request with Prof. Distelmans based on psychological distress. I have gone through the entire procedure and am now waiting for the result.   Tom and his wife had just had their third child. They both taught chemistry at Leuven University College, part of the oldest university in Belgium. When Tom received his mother s e-mail, he showed it to his supervisor, Lies Verdonck, a doctor who was familiar with Distelmans s work, and asked her what to do. She said there was no way that Distelmans would approve the euthanasia request without first speaking with the patient s family.  Stay focussed on your job and your children,  she urged Tom.  At the time, Tom was in the process of searching for a nursing home for Godelieva s mother, from whom Godelieva was estranged. He was angry that the task had fallen to him, and felt that his mother was being manipulative. She had expressed suicidal thoughts before, and they d passed, so he decided not to respond to the e-mail. His sister, who was in Africa, replied that she would respect her mother s decision, but that it hurt her.  On April 20, 2012, three months after Godelieva sent the e-mail, Tom received a short letter from his mother that was written in the past tense. She reported that her euthanasia had been carried out on April 19th, at the university hospital of the Free University of Brussels.  I donated my body to science,  she wrote. On the back of the letter, she d left the phone number of a friend who had the keys to her house.  Tom immediately drove to the house of the friend, who offered him a drink and then explained that she and her husband had driven Godelieva to the hospital. Tom accused the couple of co perating with a suicide. They were defensive: they said that it was Godelieva s choice, and they didn t want her to have to take a taxi to the hospital alone. Later, they admitted to Tom that in the car Godelieva was chatting and laughing, and they had begun to wonder if they knew her as well as they d thought.  Tom felt his mind shutting down. He drove to his mother s house, which he hadn t visited in more than a year. She had just completed an addition to the first floor: before they separated, she and her ex-boyfriend had wanted to grow old in the house without worrying about stairs. The interior of the house was decorated with framed photographs of her grandchildren. Large drawings of Tom and his sister hung on the living-room wall.  In the drawer of Godelieva s bedroom desk, Tom found drafts of several farewell letters that she had written to friends, her neighborhood association, and a chorus that she sang in, as well as a master list with an  X  by each name, as if she were composing thank-you notes after a party. She thanked her friends for their companionship, apologized for causing them pain, and explained that  the loneliness, no chance of a cure after forty years of therapy, nothing to look forward to all this has led me to see that the only thing remaining is a dignified end of life.   There was also a draft of a long letter to her children, which was far more emotional than the one she had sent.  I have not been able to handle the rift with you, Tom,  she wrote.  I have loved you very much but you have not seen it as such.  She then addressed her three grandchildren:  I have missed you very much.  She also wrote, before crossing it out,  I will not see my grandchildren grow up and that causes me pain.   In his mother s living room, Tom found an article about Distelmans in De Morgen, a leading Flemish newspaper, which featured a large photograph of him sitting on a bed, wearing jeans, a patterned shirt, and a silver bangle bracelet. The reporter described Distelmans as a doctor who  cannot stand injustice.  Distelmans spoke about his disdain for doctors who assume that they know what their patients need, and told the reporter that the  euthanasia law has such a symbolic value. People have a voice.   Tom also discovered a booklet, produced by LEIF (Life End Information Forum), an organization founded by Distelmans, that outlined the medical and legal options available to people who are dying or want to die. On the final page, the authors introduced an excerpt from  Utopia,  by Thomas More, who describes a world in which  officially sanctioned euthanasia is regarded as an honorable death.  In More s ideal society, government officials and priests visit suffering invalids and say,  Why don t you break out and escape to a better world?   In Belgium, euthanasia is embraced as an emblem of enlightenment and progress, a sign that the country has extricated itself from its Catholic, patriarchal roots. Distelmans, who was brought up as a Catholic and then rejected the Church, told me that his work is inspired by an aversion to all forms of paternalism.  Who am I to convince patients that they have to suffer longer than they want?  he said.  Belgium was the second country in the world, after the Netherlands, to decriminalize euthanasia; it was followed by Luxembourg, in 2009, and, this year, by Canada and Colombia. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that citizens have legitimate concerns about prolonged deaths in institutional settings, but in 1997 it ruled that death is not a constitutionally protected right, leaving questions about assisted suicide to be resolved by each state. Within months of the ruling, Oregon passed a law that allows doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for patients who have less than six months to live. In 2008, Washington adopted a similar law; Montana decriminalized assisted suicide the year after; and Vermont legalized it in 2013.  The right-to-die movement has gained momentum at a time of anxiety about the graying of the population; people who are older than sixty-five represent the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, Canada, and much of Europe. But the laws seem to be motivated less by the desires of the elderly than by the concerns of a younger generation, whose members derive comfort from the knowledge that they can control the end of their lives. Diane Meier, a professor of geriatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York, and one of the leading palliative-care physicians in the country, told me that  the movement to legalize assisted suicide is driven by the  worried well,  by people who are terrified of the unknown and want to take back control.  She added,  That is not to say that the medical profession doesn t do a horrible job of protecting people from preventable suffering.  Like most doctors who specialize in palliative care, a field focussed on quality of life for patients with severe and terminal illnesses, she thinks legalizing assisted suicide is unnecessary.  The notion that if people don t kill themselves they re going to die on a ventilator in the hospital would be humorous if it weren t so serious,  she said. She believes that the angst propelling the movement would be diminished if patients had greater access to palliative care and if doctors were more attentive to their patients  psychological suffering.  In Oregon and Switzerland, studies have shown that people who request death are less motivated by physical pain than by the desire to remain autonomous. This pattern of reasoning was exemplified by Brittany Maynard, a twenty-nine-year-old newlywed who moved to Oregon last year so that she could die on her own terms rather than allowing her brain cancer to take its course. Her story appeared on the cover of People, which described her as having the  soul of an adventurer and the heart of a warrior.  She became the poster child for assisted death a far more palatable one than Jack Kevorkian, who had previously filled that role. Unlike the patients whom Kevorkian attended to with his makeshift  suicide machine,  Maynard appeared neither passive nor vulnerable. Since her death, seven months ago, lawmakers in twenty-three U.S. states have introduced bills that would make it legal for doctors to help people die.  Opponents have warned for years that legalization will lead to a  slippery slope,  but in Oregon fewer than nine hundred people have used lethal prescriptions since the law was passed, and they represent the demographic that is least likely to be coerced: they are overwhelmingly white, educated, and well-off. In Belgium and in the Netherlands, where patients can be euthanized even if they do not have a terminal illness, the laws seem to have permeated the medical establishment more deeply than elsewhere, perhaps because of the central role granted to doctors: in the majority of cases, it is the doctor, not the patient, who commits the final act. In the past five years, the number of euthanasia and assisted-suicide deaths in the Netherlands has doubled, and in Belgium it has increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Although most of the Belgian patients had cancer, people have also been euthanized because they had autism, anorexia, borderline personality disorder, chronic-fatigue syndrome, partial paralysis, blindness coupled with deafness, and manic depression. In 2013, Wim Distelmans euthanized a forty-four-year-old transgender man, Nathan Verhelst, because Verhelst was devastated by the failure of his sex-change surgeries; he said that he felt like a monster when he looked in the mirror.  Farewell, everybody,  Verhelst said from his hospital bed, seconds before receiving a lethal injection.  The laws seem to have created a new conception of suicide as a medical treatment, stripped of its tragic dimensions. Patrick Wyffels, a Belgian family doctor, told me that the process of performing euthanasia, which he does eight to ten times a year, is  very magical.  But he sometimes worries about how his own values might influence a patient s decision to die or to live.  Depending on communication techniques, I might lead a patient one way or the other,  he said. In the days before and after the procedure, he finds it difficult to sleep.  You spend seven years studying to be a doctor, and all they do is teach you how to get people well and then you do the opposite,  he told me.  I am afraid of the power that I have in that moment.   Although doctors in Belgium had been covertly performing euthanasia before it was legalized, the majority of them opposed the euthanasia law, according to a survey conducted at the time. The chairman of Belgium s largest medical association cautioned against making  the exception the rule.  But the political composition of the Belgian government had recently shifted; for the first time since the Second World War, secular politicians (liberals, socialists, and the Green Party) had more power than Christian Democrats, who resisted legalization. Peter Backx, the former editor of Belgium s largest medical journal, said that the law seemed like a  bit of political revenge.  At the Senate hearings on the law, the phrase  self-determination  was repeated ninety-seven times.  The right to a dignified death is viewed as an accomplishment of secular humanism, one of seven belief systems that are officially recognized by the government. Belgian humanism, which was deeply influenced by the nineteenth-century Freemasonry movement, offered an outlet for those who felt oppressed by the Church, but it has increasingly come to resemble the kind of institution that it once defined itself against. Since 1981, the Belgian government has paid for  humanist counsellors,  the secular equivalent of clergy, to provide moral guidance in hospitals, prisons, and the armed forces. Humanist values are also taught in state schools, in a course called non-confessional ethics, which is taken by secular children from first through twelfth grade, while religious students pursue theological studies. The course emphasizes autonomy, free inquiry, democracy, and an ethics based on reason and science, not on revelation. Jan Bernheim, an emeritus professor of medicine at the Free University of Brussels, who studies ethics and quality of life, told me that euthanasia is  part of a philosophy of taking control of one s own existence and improving the objective conditions for happiness. There is an arrow of evolution that goes toward ever more reducing of suffering and maximizing of enjoyment.   The Belgian Council of Ministers appointed Wim Distelmans to serve as the chairman of the Federal Control and Evaluation Commission, which reviews euthanasia deaths to insure that doctors have complied with the law. In terminal cases, two doctors need to confirm that the patient s suffering stems from an incurable illness. For non-terminal cases, three doctors must agree. But doctors have adopted increasingly loose interpretations of disease. Distelmans told me,  We at the commission are confronted more and more with patients who are tired of dealing with a sum of small ailments they are what we call  tired of life.    Although their suffering derives from social concerns as well as from medical ones, Distelmans said that he still considers their pain to be incurable.  If you ask for euthanasia because you are alone, and you are alone because you don t have family to take care of you, we cannot create family,  he said.  Last year, thirteen per cent of the Belgians who were euthanized did not have a terminal condition, and roughly three per cent suffered from psychiatric disorders. In Flanders, where the dominant language is Dutch, euthanasia accounts for nearly five per cent of all deaths. (The percentage is lower in the southern, French-speaking parts of Belgium.) The Flemish media have adopted a mostly uncritical approach to euthanasia, running numerous articles about the courage of people who have chosen to die. Last year, De Standaard, a prominent Flemish newspaper, published a long tribute to a depressed mother who was euthanized after being abandoned by her boyfriend and becoming disillusioned by her psychiatric care.  I am forever grateful to her that she handled this so well,  her twenty-four-year-old son told the paper.  I am so glad we were able to say goodbye in a beautiful way.   The suicide rate in Belgium (excluding cases of euthanasia) is the second-highest in Western Europe, a phenomenon often attributed to the Flemish personality type known as  binnenvetter,  a person who holds emotions inside. Joris Vandenberghe, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Leuven and a member of the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, said that he finds euthanasia requests therapeutically useful, because they prompt patients who would not otherwise seek medical help to consult with doctors about their feelings of hopelessness. He said that most of his patients, even those who are approved for euthanasia, end up deciding that they want to live. But he rejects the idea that suicide is always an indication of pathology.  There s a whole philosophical history of looking at suicide as a rational choice,  he said.  We, as humans, have the possibility to weigh our own life and decide to end it.   Tom believes that everyone is suicidal in at least some small way. In his early twenties, the impulse was strong.  There was a red light constantly flickering above me,  he said. He undertook what he called  aggressive reading : Dostoyevsky, Antonin Artaud, Freud, S ndor Ferenczi, Tolstoy, Carl Jung. He found himself drawn to theories of suffering. He wanted to know what it was that made one person survive and another give up.  When Tom was twenty-two, he enrolled in graduate school, for chemistry, but instead of studying he researched his father s suicide. He often took the train to Ghent, where his father had worked, and interviewed his colleagues and friends. Godelieva, following the advice of her psychiatrist at the time, hadn t told her children how their father died; she said only that he suffered from headaches. Tom and his sister quickly figured it out. Tom began to see his father as a kind of Dorian Gray figure: he had lived extravagantly, seeking pleasure, success, and distraction. He drove a new Mercedes while he owed millions of Belgian francs and was under the threat of legal action.  He could not see himself as he really was,  Tom recalled. He left a suicide note on his bathroom mirror that said,  I am a victim of the shit that exists in the world today.   In her diary, Godelieva wrote that she couldn t comprehend why her husband would kill himself. But at other times she felt that she understood perfectly I am just like him,  she wrote but she said that, for the sake of the children, she could never do the same. Neither Tom nor his sister thought that she would have killed herself on her own. She was passive, dependent, and averse to risk. She didn t like to make a mess. Most of all, she trusted her doctors  authority. Distelmans was the last in a series of charismatic and accomplished doctors whose theories she had revered. After finding strength in their guidance, she eventually became disillusioned by each treatment.  I can still hardly believe how many amateurs are walking around in this medical field,  she wrote to a friend in the late nineties, after giving up on another therapist.  When Tom read his mother s daily planner, he saw that she had met with Distelmans at least six times in the past eight months. Seven weeks before her death, she donated twenty-five hundred euros to LEIF , the organization that Distelmans had founded. On the bank-transfer form she had written,  Thanks to the staff at LEIF .   Until Godelieva s death, Tom had never given much thought to euthanasia, though he was vaguely in favor of it.  Distelmans was just a voice I heard on the radio from time to time,  he told me. Tom was brought up as an atheist, and in school he had studied non-confessional ethics. When the euthanasia law was passed, he and his wife, who were in the same graduate program, had recently fallen in love. They assumed that the law was for old people who were already dying.  Now it seemed to Tom that there were few people reflecting critically on the law. Three days after his mother s death, the leading Belgian humanist association named Distelmans one of ten  heroes of self-determination  in the past fifty years, at a celebration for Flemish Heritage Day. When Tom complained to the ombudsman at the hospital of the Free University of Brussels, the ombudsman replied that everything had proceeded according to his mother s  free will.  Even Godelieva s friends reserved judgment; few had realized that she suffered from clinical depression. At her memorial service, people skirted the issue. They told one another that you never know how someone is feeling inside, and that  every house has its own cross,  an attitude that Tom described as typically Flemish. Tom likes to joke that he must have some secret French roots, because he finds it nearly impossible to contain his feelings.  Godelieva s friend Christiane Geuens told me that she knew that Godelieva was upset about her breakup, but she never imagined that she was considering euthanasia. Less than two weeks before she died, Godelieva had spent all day at Geuens s home. Godelieva lit a fire and then sat on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, and told stories. The only indication that something was off was the movie she decided to watch. She wanted to see  Sophie s Choice.  She had already seen the movie and read the book, and afterward she went on about her identification with Sophie, who was so burdened by her past that she committed suicide. Geuens didn t see how their situations were comparable, but Godelieva said that they were the same.  A week after his mother s death, Tom e-mailed a psychiatrist named Lieve Thienpont, whose name he had seen several times in his mother s daily planner.  May I ask why you approved active euthanasia for my mother and why I was never involved in that decision?  he wrote. Thienpont invited him to meet with her and Distelmans, both of whom are founding members of Ulteam, a clinic for patients who have questions about ending their lives. In the past three years, nine hundred patients have come to Ulteam, half of whom complained that they were suffering psychologically, not physically.  On May 15, 2012, Tom went to Distelmans s clinic, a small brick modernist building in a residential suburb on the outskirts of Brussels. He brought his colleague Steven Bieseman along for moral support.  I was there to help Tom control his emotions, because he can be quite hot-tempered,  Bieseman, a doctor, told me.  They sat at a conference table, and Distelmans explained that he never rushes his decisions. He said that he had urged Godelieva to contact her children, but that she had not wanted to inform them. He asked Tom why he had scheduled the meeting.   Because you killed my mother,  Tom replied.  Distelmans responded calmly that it was Godelieva s  absolute wish  to die.  Tom said that his mother s  absolute wish  was also to be a good grandmother. He had brought some of her papers and letters, and he began reading from the draft of her suicide letter to him and his sister.  I feel frustration and sadness because I have not been able to build a connection,  he read. Then he showed them an apology letter that he had written to his mother when he was twenty, after one of many fights.  Forgive me,  he read.  You have dealt with the worst. . . . You care about me. I am not living up to your expectations. That hurts. I don t know how to deal with that.   Distelmans was silent.  He was very cool, very distant,  Bieseman said.  He didn t seem to be touched.   When Tom saw that his reading had elicited no response, he pushed his chair back from the table and stood up. Bieseman recalled,  He was screaming,  You went along with the madness of my mother! You went along with her tunnel vision, her defeatism. You ve just taken away the suffering of one person and transposed it to another!     Distelmans repeated that he was certain that Godelieva had wanted to die, and that this was her right. Then he said that it seemed there was nothing left to discuss. They all stood up and shook hands, and Tom and Bieseman left the clinic.  Distelmans told me that he had no doubts about the way he handled Godelieva s case. He explained that she was  a very nice person, a very warm person,  and that she had  wanted to do one decent thing in her life, and that is to die in a decent way, because the rest of her life was such a horrible mess.  When I asked if he worried about transference perhaps she had idolized him or depended too much on his opinion he laughed and said,  I ve never met a patient who is willing to die to please someone else.   Thienpont, whose practice is mostly devoted to issues surrounding euthanasia, was similarly confident about the decision to end Godelieva s life. Since Ulteam opened, in 2011, Thienpont said it has been  overrun by psychiatric patients a phenomenon that she attributes to the poor quality of psychiatric care in the country. In Belgium, it is not uncommon for patients to live in psychiatric institutions for years. Outpatient care is minimal, poorly funded, and fragmented, as it is in most countries. In a new book, called  Libera Me,  Thienpont urges doctors to accept the limits of psychiatry, and argues that some patients live with so much pain, their thoughts unceasingly directed toward death, that their mental illnesses should be considered  terminal.  Before approving a euthanasia request, she does not require patients to try procedures that they think are invasive. Godelieva had never had electroconvulsive therapy, though it is effective for about half of patients with depression.  Sometimes it really is too late,  Thienpont told me.  If the patient s energy is gone, then it is not humane to say,  Well, maybe if you go to a hospital that specializes in your problem for two more years it will help.  I think we have to respect when people say,  No that is enough.     Euthanasia for psychiatric patients was rare in the early years of the law, but patients complained that they were being unfairly stigmatized: psychic suffering, they argued, was just as unbearable as physical pain. Like cancer patients, they were subjected to futile treatments that diminished their quality of life. Dirk De Wachter, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Leuven and the president of the ethics commission for the university s psychiatric center, said that he reconsidered his opposition to euthanasia after a patient whose request he had rejected committed suicide. In 2004, she set up a camera in front of a newspaper office in Antwerp and set herself on fire.  De Wachter believes that the country s approach to suicide reflects a crisis of nihilism created by the rapid secularization of Flemish culture in the past thirty years. Euthanasia became a humanist solution to a humanist dilemma.  What is life worth when there is no God?  he said.  What is life worth when I am not successful?  He said that he has repeatedly been confronted by patients who tell him,  I am an autonomous decision-maker. I can decide how long I live. When I think my life is not worth living anymore, I must decide.  He recently approved the euthanasia of a twenty-five-year-old woman with borderline personality disorder who did not  suffer from depression in the psychiatric sense of the word,  he said.  It was more existential; it was impossible for her to have a goal in this life.  He said that her parents  came to my office, got on their knees, and begged me,  Please, help our daughter to die.     De Wachter told me,  I don t want to kill people I don t think psychiatrists should kill people but when the suffering is so extreme we cannot look the other way.  When he gives lectures, he tries to appeal to Christian audiences by saying,  If Jesus were here, I think he would help these people.   Ren  Stockman, the director of a Catholic organization, Brothers of Charity, which says that it runs a third of the psychiatric institutions in Belgium, told me,  They are using our Christian vocabulary in a new context. They say they are  saving  people from their bad lives, through  mercy  and  compassion.  I cannot accept that.  He sees euthanasia as a failure of both psychiatry and medical education.  Any questions about ethics they say,  Oh, we need a specialist for that.  They are not learning to reflect morally on what they are doing.   In the months after his mother s death, Tom searched online for criticism of the Belgian approach to euthanasia, but it seemed to take only two forms: objections from Catholics, who argued that life is sacred and only God should end it, and from Holocaust survivors and their descendants, who were disturbed to see doctors delving into the business of judging whether certain lives were worth living. Although the latter concern blurs a fundamental distinction under the Nazis, the sick and the disabled never asked to die it was exacerbated by the fact that Distelmans led seventy medical professionals and scholars on a  study trip  to Auschwitz last year. A brochure for the trip explained that for those who are  constantly confronted with existential pain and questions about the meaning of life  Auschwitz is an  inspiring place to contemplate these issues.   In October, 2012, Tom compiled a list of thirty Belgian physicians and academics who had publicly questioned the law and sent them a long e-mail about his mother s death.  The fact that W. Distelmans has euthanized my mother without contacting me or my sister keeps festering,  he wrote.  It is difficult for me to grasp that right now there is no public basis and political support to combat these absurd practices.   Herman De Dijn, a Spinoza scholar, responded. He cautioned Tom that the Belgian media would not be receptive to his opinion. De Dijn, an emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Leuven, said that Godelieva s story sounded like  utopia realized: everything is neat and clean and terrible.  He was troubled by the way that his colleagues  theories about autonomy seemed to have stiffened into ideology, a mentality that the euthanasia law both reflected and encouraged.  Once the law is there, you have people asking themselves new questions,  he told me.  Do I really have quality of life? Am I not a burden on others?  He believed that  human dignity should include not only respect for personal choices but also for connectedness to loved ones and society.  He worried that the concept had been  reduced to the ability to have certain experiences.   Emboldened by De Dijn s response, Tom wrote an essay that built on his theories. The seed for the essay was a notice for a lecture, called  On the Sofa with Wim Distelmans,  that he saw on the Web site of a youth organization. Over pastries and coffee, Distelmans would discuss euthanasia with teen-agers. Tom sent a version of the essay, originally titled  Euthanasia on the Sofa,  to Flanders s leading newspaper and magazine, both of which rejected it. Eventually, it was published in Artsenkrant, a magazine for physicians.  I am afraid that the notion of  free will  has become dogma, behind which it is easy to hide,  he wrote.  Wouldn t it be better to invest in mental health and palliative care?   The Flemish newspaper De Morgen picked up the story and ran an article summarizing Tom s complaints. Two days later, Jacinta De Roeck, one of three senators who sponsored the euthanasia law and the director of Belgium s Liberal-Humanist Association, published an op-ed in the paper, asserting that there had been no abuses of the law since it was passed, ten years earlier.  Fortunately our society has started to understand that there can be mental suffering that is unbearable, and cannot in any way be lessened,  she wrote.  Sometimes a patient sees only one possible solution: euthanasia, within the perfectly drawn lines of the law. No one has the right to disapprove of this choice.   The next week, Tony Van Loon, a professor of moral sciences at the Free University of Brussels, who is Thienpont s longtime partner, wrote an article in De Morgen titled  The Right to Self-Determination Is the Ultimate Answer.  Van Loon, who works with Ulteam, alluded to Godelieva s case by describing her as  a mother who says her suffering is unbearable, in part because of the troubled relationship with her son.  He said that the patients at Ulteam had been ignored and silenced by other doctors.  May they be allowed to die like human beings?  he wrote.  Or must they wait until they are nothing more than a corpse so that their next of kin can comfort themselves with their remains?   In the summer of 2013, Tom asked a doctor named Georges Casteur to inspect his mother s medical records. Casteur, the former president of the provincial council of the doctors of West Flanders, had performed euthanasia several times in his career, but he believed that it should be used only for patients who are close to death.  There s a great difference between helping people who are already dying and helping people to die,  he told me. He didn t understand why physicians were framing the latter as a patient s right.  My colleagues are so against paternalism that they say,  You want to die? O.K., I ll kill you.     Casteur reviewed Godelieva s medical file at Distelmans s clinic, with Distelmans sitting beside him. Casteur says that he learned that Godelieva had struggled to find three doctors who would say that she had an incurable illness, as the law required. One psychiatrist wrote that her desire for euthanasia was  not mature,  because she had  ups and downs.  According to Casteur, a second concluded that she could still be helped; the psychiatrist observed that when Godelieva discussed her grandchildren she became emotional and expressed doubts about her decision to die. In addition to Thienpont, Distelmans consulted Godelieva s former therapist, who wrote that,  after recent rejection by her latest partner and by her children, her psychiatric issues will not improve.  Two weeks before Godelieva s death, Distelmans asked if he could call her children, but she refused.  It would not change her decision anyway,  Distelmans wrote. She died with three photographs in her pocket: a picture of her holding Tom on her lap when he was a baby, a picture of her feeding one of Tom s young daughters ice cream, and a photograph of her and her daughter walking together through a field.  Based on Casteur s notes, Tom submitted a complaint with the Belgian Order of Physicians and the public prosecutor of Brussels, alleging that Godelieva s condition had not been incurable. A reunion with her children and her grandchildren, he argued, might have alleviated the loneliness that was at the core of her suffering.  When a Dutch news service reported on Tom s complaint, Tom found himself reading all the comments online. People accused him of using Distelmans as a scapegoat, of placing his own needs before his mother s, of not understanding the law, of being secretly Catholic. Then he saw a comment by a woman named Margot Vandevenne.  To those who reacted in such a way: you have no idea how it is to experience something like that!  she wrote.  This is an unbearable pain that you can only know when you have experienced this YOURSELF .  In a second comment, she wrote that Distelmans  euthanized my mother half a year ago because of depression, and I wasn t told until a day after her death, and not even by the doctor.   Vandevenne, who was nineteen and had a young son, had filed a criminal complaint against Distelmans, but she worried that nothing would come of it. The investigative process is confidential, and, in the past thirteen years, no case has been referred for prosecution. Tom encouraged Vandevenne to file a complaint with the Order of Physicians and offered to help her write it. Her mother, who was fifty-four when she died, had been mourning the recent deaths of both of her parents and suffered from depression, unexplained pain, and an inability to  find a meaningful purpose in her life,  as one doctor wrote. On March 8, 2014, Margot sent the Order of Physicians a letter protesting the circumstances of her mother s death.  My son and I have not even had the chance to say goodbye to my mother,  she wrote.  I wonder every day whether I would have been able to change her mind if I had been informed.   Less than a week later, the philosopher Etienne Vermeersch, the former president of the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, wrote an editorial in De Morgen accusing Tom and others of conducting a  smear campaign.   They are filing complaints with the Order of Physicians and with the court in order to frighten generous doctors with the spectre of prosecution,  he wrote.  If this disastrous strategy succeeded, hundreds of people in extreme need would once again no longer be helped.  He wrote that Belgium  stands, ethically, at the top of the world.  He republished the editorial on a Web site and urged anyone who objected to the recent criticism to sign a petition. More than seven thousand people did, including senators and representatives, the country s minister of social affairs and health, the former mayor of Antwerp, academics, artists, actors, journalists, novelists, sports figures, and doctors from Ulteam.  Vermeersch, who is eighty-one and was recently voted the most influential intellectual in Flanders, was one of the country s earliest proponents of euthanasia, and he sees the law as his progeny. Last year, he successfully campaigned for legislation that made children with incurable illnesses eligible for euthanasia, and he, along with several politicians, is now working to expand the law so that people with dementia can be euthanized, provided they articulate their wishes in advance. When I met him at his home, a spectacularly messy house, with piles of boxes blocking the view out his windows, he told me that he did not think Godelieva s case was particularly complex; he said that he d seen cases that were more  delicate.  He described a couple who came to him for guidance after their bipolar daughter had been euthanized. They were sure that if she had waited a few months her pessimism would have lifted. Of this case, Vermeersch said,  I see that there is a problem, but you also have to look at the two sides.   Vermeersch seemed to refer to death as an option that had upsides and downsides, like any other choice, and I mentioned that it appeared that a lot of people in Belgium were less afraid of death than I was.  Vermeersch looked at me as if he were recalculating my age downward.  How can you be afraid of nothing?  he said.  Nothing can do you no harm.   I said,  I m afraid of not existing.    Millions and billions of years you did not exist what was the problem?    But now I ve formed relationships,  I said.   After death, your relationships are finished,  he said brightly.  You are in the state you were before conception.   Tom likes to joke that he has  seven thousand enemies,  the people who signed Vermeersch s petition. He refers to his insecurity complex so often that it seems to have taken on a concrete existence of its own. He alternates between denouncing the leading philosophers in Belgium and feeling ashamed of the idea that he would judge anyone.  I don t want to get trapped in a situation where I feel that I am worth something,  he told me.  Vermeersch s petition gained Tom some notoriety, and people began introducing him to others who had become disenchanted by aspects of the law. Recently, he began corresponding with the daughter of Lily Boeykens, the country s most prominent feminist, who asked for euthanasia because she showed preliminary signs of Alzheimer s. After two doctors rejected her request she was still living on her own, giving interviews, and throwing dinner parties Boeykens, who was seventy-four, found a neurologist at the University of Antwerp, Peter De Deyn, who agreed to euthanize her. She told the doctor, who studied Alzheimer s, that she would give him her brain for his research. In an audiotaped conversation, she explained to her daughter that  De Deyn will keep the part of my body that he needs.   On the morning on which the euthanasia was scheduled, Boeykens s daughter, Kerstin, said that she called De Deyn, crying, and begged him to move her mother s 9 A . M . appointment a few hours later, so that she would have time to drop her children off at school and then drive to the clinic. But De Deyn said that he was booked for the rest of the day. (De Deyn denies that this happened.) Records show that Boeykens died at 9:20 A . M ., at which point De Deyn removed her brain and performed an autopsy. Kerstin filed a complaint with the Belgian Order of Physicians, writing that  my mother and Dr. P. P. De Deyn made a deal: brains in exchange for assistance with suicide.   De Deyn, who has euthanized thirty patients suffering from dementia, maintained that the euthanasia date had been determined before they discussed the donation of Boeykens s brain. He dismissed Kerstin s account, telling me that she was a psychiatric patient the same thing that Distelmans said about Tom when discounting his complaints. (Kerstin said that she has no history of psychiatric treatment, a fact that her primary-care doctor confirmed.) The chairman of the Belgian Order of Physicians told Kerstin that she would not be informed of the consequences of her complaint because the process was secret.  I am pro-euthanasia I don t want to get rid of it,  she told me.  I just want to shut down these cowboys. They re a clique; they protect each other.   Last fall, Tom filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the law in Belgium lacked safeguards to prevent abuse. His complaint referred to a recent study in the British Medical Journal, which found that only half of euthanasia cases in Flanders had been reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Commission. There were no repercussions for failing to report euthanasia deaths to the commission, a situation likely aided by the fact that nearly half of the sixteen members on the commission are affiliated with right-to-die associations.  Tom felt so aggrieved by Distelmans s prominence that he tried not to talk about him while driving. Each time Distelmans received a prize or a grant and there have been many Tom took it as a personal insult. His anger at his mother was channelled toward her doctor, who seemed to be everywhere. Last spring, Tom was reviewing his eight-year-old daughter s journal for school, as he does every night, when he saw in the pages a flyer with Distelmans s face on it.  Euthanasia lecture: With Wim Distelmans,  it said. It had been put there by his daughter s non-confessional-ethics teacher, who is also the chair of the local humanist chapter. Tom and his wife e-mailed the school s principal to complain that the ethics teacher was promoting a lecture by the doctor who had euthanized the grandmother of one of her pupils. The principal apologized for causing discomfort but explained that the  flyer has only an informative character which gives parents the opportunity to get informed about this contemporary humanist subject.  She wrote that the subject of euthanasia was in keeping with the curriculum, but she said that she would advise teachers not to discuss it until after the second grade.  Tom thought about pulling his daughter out of non-confessional ethics but decided not to, because it wouldn t make sense for her to study Catholicism the other class offered during that period and he didn t want her to have to sit alone for two hours every week. She was popular, and he didn t want her to feel like an outsider. His wife, who has an aura of quiet competence, had managed to keep their domestic life remarkably regular in the years since Godelieva s death. They live in a suburb of Leuven, in a clean, bright, square house that they designed themselves; when they were shopping for architectural models, the word they kept repeating was  practical.  Tom s tone of voice shifts when he talks about his children. He seems suddenly light.  At times, Tom appeared almost bewildered by his stability a fulfilling job, a loving marriage, three healthy children. He assumed that at some point he must have decided to live, a choice that still surprises him. He attributed it to some sort of primitive drive to know how things would turn out.  I wanted to see if I was capable of becoming someone,  he said, before adding that he still doesn t know. When he becomes depressed or dramatic, his wife tells him to think of their children, and says,  You have no choice but to continue,  a phrase that Tom repeats often.  On one of my last days in Belgium, Tom took me to meet his grandmother, whose flaws Godelieva had described so relentlessly that Tom had trouble seeing her as a person in her own right. Tom had always felt a little wary of her, but his grandmother had been a steady presence in his life, and he had come to appreciate that. Tom visits her about once a month, for half an hour, until they run out of things to say.  As soon as we arrived, Tom spotted her walking down the hallway toward the cafeteria. She was dressed like a schoolgirl, in a long skirt, a maroon cardigan, and a starched white shirt buttoned to the base of her neck. Her excitement at seeing her grandson was mild. She nodded, smiled timidly, and led us upstairs to her room.  She sat on a cushioned chair, her ankles crossed, while Tom opened her cabinet and took out an antique box of photographs, most of which had been taken at the farm where she had grown up and spent most of her life.  Good pictures, Oma,  he said as he shuffled through several piles, searching for older photographs. He finally found what he wanted: photographs of British soldiers who had recuperated at the farm after the Second World War. His grandmother had fallen in love with one of the soldiers, and they had planned to marry. But, at the last minute, to please her parents, she married Tom s grandfather instead.  Years later, his grandmother searched for the soldier, and, when they were in their seventies, after the deaths of their spouses, they reunited.  They had one romantic summer before he died,  Tom told me. He showed me a picture of his grandmother and the veteran standing in front of the farm, holding hands and beaming.  I said that it was a very nice picture.   Yeah, but it destroyed everything,  Tom said, explaining that his grandmother had spent fifty years married to a man she didn t love. He repeated a phrase that his mother had written several times in her diary:  You can feel whatever you want on the inside, but never let it show on the outside.   After we left, Tom explained that his mother had always said that she wasn t  conceived out of love.  At the thought, he seemed to soften toward her.  She really had a tough time,  he said.  She was in pain I m not going to say anything different.   He began speaking about how traumas are passed from one generation to the next, and how suicides, perhaps more than any other death, reverberate through a family. It was an idea that we d discussed many times, and, when I didn t immediately respond, he seemed to tire of it.  Well, it is what it is,  he said.  We have to continue. People will always start over.

{'site_name': 'The New Yorker', 'author': '', 'text': 'On a bright October morning, Suhail Doshi drove to Silicon Valley in his parents  Honda Civic, carrying a laptop with a twelve-slide presentation that was surely worth at least fifty million dollars. Doshi, the twenty-six-year-old C.E.O. of a data-analytics startup called Mixpanel, had come from San Francisco to Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, where many of the world s most prestigious venture-capital firms cluster, to pitch Andreessen Horowitz, the road s newest and most unusual firm. Inside the offices, he stood at the head of a massive beechwood conference table to address the firm s deal team and its seven general partners the men who venture the money, take a seat on the board, and fire the entrepreneur if things go wrong.  Marc Andreessen, the firm s co-founder, fixed his gaze on Doshi as he disinfected his germless hands with a sanitizing wipe. Andreessen is forty-three years old and six feet five inches tall, with a cranium so large, bald, and oblong that you can t help but think of words like  jumbo  and  Grade A.  Two decades ago, he was the animating spirit of Netscape, the Web browser that launched the Internet boom. In many respects, he is the quintessential Silicon Valley venture capitalist: an imposing, fortyish, long-celebrated white man. (Forbes s Midas List of the top hundred V.C.s includes just five women.) But, whereas most V.C.s maintain a casual-Friday vibe, Andreessen seethes with beliefs. He s an evangelist for the church of technology, afire to reorder life as we know it. He believes that tech products will soon erase such primitive behaviors as paying cash (Bitcoin), eating cooked food (Soylent), and enduring a world unimproved by virtual reality (Oculus VR). He believes that Silicon Valley is mission control for mankind, which is therefore on a steep trajectory toward perfection. And when he so argues, fire-hosing you with syllogisms and data points and pre-refuting every potential rebuttal, he s very persuasive.  Doshi, lean and quizzical in a maroon T-shirt and jeans, began his pitch by declaring,  Most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut. They will be either lucky or wrong.  Far better to apply Mixpanel s analytics, which enable mobile-based companies to know exactly who their customers are and how they use their apps. Doshi rapidly escalated to rhetoric We want to do data science for every single market in the world that would sound bumptious anywhere but on Sand Hill Road, where the young guy in jeans is obligated to astound the middle-aged guys in cashmere V-necks.  Mediocre V.C.s want to see that your company has traction,  Doshi told me.  The top V.C.s want you to show them you can invent the future.   If you have a crackerjack idea, one of your stops on Sand Hill Road will be Andreessen Horowitz, often referred to by its alphanumeric URL, a16z. (There are sixteen letters between the  a  in Andreessen and the  z  in Horowitz.) Since the firm was launched, six years ago, it has vaulted into the top echelon of venture concerns. Competing V.C.s, disturbed by its speed and its power and the lavish prices it paid for deals, gave it another nickname: AHo. Each year, three thousand startups approach a16z with a  warm intro  from someone the firm knows. A16z invests in fifteen. Of those, at least ten will fold, three or four will prosper, and one might soar to be worth more than a billion dollars a  unicorn,  in the local parlance. With great luck, once a decade that unicorn will become a Google or a Facebook and return the V.C. s money a thousand times over: the storied 1,000x. There are eight hundred and three V.C. firms in the U.S., and last year they spent forty-eight billion dollars chasing that dream.  Doshi had run the gantlet before. In 2012, he tracked down Andreessen and his equally if less splendidly bald co-founder, Ben Horowitz, at a Ritz-Carlton near Tucson. Then he pitched them in the lobby (having made sure that his parents  Honda, which contained his father, was well out of sight). Doshi mentioned that he d become so dissatisfied with the incumbent database software that he d built his own. Andreessen later told me that this  was like a cub reporter saying,  I need to write the Great American Novel before I can really file this story.    A16z gave Doshi ten million dollars, and he gave it twenty-five per cent of his company.  Now he was back for more. He zipped through his slides: hundred-per-cent growth rate; head count doubling every six to nine months; and he still had all the money he d raised last time. As Andreessen drank an iced tea in two gulps and began to roam the room, Doshi called up a slide that showed his competitors Localytics, Amplitude, Google Analytics grouped into quadrants. Then he explained how he d crush each quadrant.  I want to buy a machine-learning team, I want to buy cutting-edge server hardware,  he said. Indicating his all-but-obliterated competitors, he added,  I want to buy stuff no one here can afford.  He jammed his hands in his pockets: questions?  While entrepreneurs attack with historiography The great-man view of history is correct, and I am that great man! V.C.s defend with doubletalk.  You re definitely going to get funded!  means  But not by us.   Who else is in?  means  Besides not us.  And  I m not sure I would ever use your product myself  means  So long!  But the best V.C.s test the entrepreneur s mettle as well as their own assumptions. Andreessen gripped the back of his chair.  So one way to describe what you re doing is a network effect,  he said.  More data gives you more customers, which allows you to build more services, which gives you more data, which allows you to get more customers, and you just turn the crank.  Doshi thought this over and said,  Sure!  Andreessen grinned: he s a systems thinker, and he d grasped how Mixpanel fit into the system. After the pitch, he told me that Mixpanel is  a picks-and-shovels business right in the middle of the gold rush.   When a startup is just an idea and a few employees, it looks for seed-round funding. When it has a product that early adopters like or when it s run through its seed-round money it tries to raise an A round. Once the product catches on, it s time for a B round, and on the rounds go. Most V.C.s contemplating an investment in one of these early rounds consider the same factors.  The bottom seventy per cent of V.C.s just go down a checklist,  Jordan Cooper, a New York entrepreneur and V.C., said.  Monthly recurring revenue? Founder with experience? Good sales pipeline? X per cent of month-over-month growth?  V.C.s also pattern-match. If the kids are into Snapchat, fund things like it: Yik Yak, Streetchat, ooVoo. Or, at a slightly deeper level, if two dropouts from Stanford s computer-science Ph.D. program created Google, fund more Stanford C.S.P. dropouts, because they blend superior capacity with monetizable dissatisfaction.  Venture capitalists with a knack for the 1,000x know that true innovations don t follow a pattern. The future is always stranger than we expect: mobile phones and the Internet, not flying cars. Doug Leone, one of the leaders of Sequoia Capital, by consensus Silicon Valley s top firm, said,  The biggest outcomes come when you break your previous mental model. The black-swan events of the past forty years the PC, the router, the Internet, the iPhone nobody had theses around those. So what s useful to us is having Dumbo ears. * A great V.C. keeps his ears pricked for a disturbing story with the elements of a fairy tale. This tale begins in another age (which happens to be the future), and features a lowborn hero who knows a secret from his hardscrabble experience. The hero encounters royalty (the V.C.s) who test him, and he harnesses magic (technology) to prevail. The tale ends in heaping treasure chests for all, borne home on the unicorn s back.  At pitch meetings, Andreessen is relatively measured: he reserves his passion for the deal review afterward, when the firm decides whether to invest. That s where he asks questions that oblige his partners to envision a new world. For the ride-sharing service Lyft:  Don t think about how big the taxi market is. What if people no longer owned cars?  For OfferUp:  What if all this selling online eBay and Craigslist goes to mobile? How big could it be?  Ben Horowitz, who sits next to his co-founder at the head of the table, is an astute manager who quotes the rap lyrics of his friends Nas and Kanye West to inspire fearless thinking but he doesn t try to manage Andreessen.  If you say to Marc,  Don t bite somebody s fucking head off!,  that would be wrong,  Horowitz said.  Because a lot of his value, when you re making giant decisions for huge amounts of money, is saying,  Why aren t you fucking considering this and this and this?     A16z was designed to be a full-throated argument about the future, a design predicated on its founders  comfort with conflict. In 1996, when Horowitz was a Netscape product manager, he wrote a note to Andreessen, accusing him of prematurely revealing the company s new strategy to a reporter. Andreessen wrote back to say that it would be Horowitz s fault if the company failed:  Next time do the fucking interview yourself. Fuck you.  Ordinarily, relationship over.  When he feels disrespected, Marc can cut you out of his life like a cancer,  one of Andreessen s close friends said.  But Ben and Marc fight like cats and dogs, then forget about it.  Two years later, when Netscape was floundering and forty per cent of its employees left, Horowitz announced that he was staying no matter what. Andreessen had never trusted anyone before, but he began to consider it. Their teamwork at a16z is complementary: Horowitz is the people-person C.E.O., and Andreessen is the farsighted theorist, the chairman. Yet Horowitz noted that  Marc is much more sensitive than I am, actually. He ll get upset about my body language God damn it, Ben, you look like you re going to throw up when I m talking about this!     Although Andreessen has been a board member of Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, and eBay, he doesn t take many board seats in a16z s portfolio companies, preferring to train his eyes on the horizon. Andreessen is tomorrow s advance man, routinely laying out  what will happen in the next ten, twenty, thirty years,  as if he were glancing at his Google calendar. He views his acuity as a matter of careful observation and extrapolation, and often invokes William Gibson s observation  The future is already here it s just not very evenly distributed.  Jet packs have been around for half a century, but you still can t buy them at Target. To smooth out such lumps in distribution, Andreessen disseminates his views via every available podcast and panel discussion and CNN interview slot: he s a media soothsayer, Andreessen the Magnificent. He also tweets a hundred and ten times a day, inundating his three hundred and ten thousand followers with aphorisms and statistics and tweetstorm jeremiads. Andreessen says that he loves Twitter because  reporters are obsessed with it. It s like a tube and I have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world.  He believes that if you say it often enough and insistently enough it will come a glorious revenge. He told me,  We have this theory of nerd nation, of forty or fifty million people all over the world who believe that other nerds have more in common with them than the people in their own country. So you get to choose what tribe or band or group you re a part of.  The nation-states of Twitter will map the world.  Mixpanel was emblematic of Silicon Valley s outsized worship of unicorns. At the company s deal review, Peter Levine, who sits on Doshi s board, reported that the entrepreneur had e-mailed to say that he d love for his company to be valued at a billion dollars an assessment that would set the price for the portion of it that a16z might now buy. However, Doshi would sell the firm ten per cent of his company for eighty million, suggesting a valuation of eight hundred million dollars. Andreessen said,  The dogs are fucking jumping through the screen door to eat the dog food. And he hasn t done any marketing yet. And he s profitable!   Horowitz exclaimed,  How old is he, twenty-four? God damn it, let s give him all our money!  A16z provided Doshi all his B-round funding sixty-five million dollars for a further 7.5 per cent of the company, which was thus valued at eight hundred and sixty-five million dollars. Doshi was a little sorry that Mixpanel wasn t valued at a billion dollars, but he told me that he could wait: his business was growing so fast, and everyone was raising money so frequently in the current boom, that  in six or twelve months we ll be a unicorn.   Venture firms rarely do an entire follow-on round themselves, for fear of losing sight of a company s true market value; as Andreessen put it,  You can be thinking your shit smells like ice cream.  None of the half-dozen other firms that Doshi pitched last fall valued his company as highly as a16z did. But Andreessen applied a maxim from his friend and intellectual sparring partner Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in LinkedIn and Yelp. When a reputable venture firm leads two consecutive rounds of investment in a company, Andreessen told me, Thiel believes that that is  a screaming buy signal, and the bigger the markup on the last round the more undervalued the company is.  Thiel s point, which takes a moment to digest, is that, when a company grows extremely rapidly, even its bullish V.C.s, having recently set a relatively low value on the previous round, will be slightly stuck in the past. The faster the growth, the farther behind they ll be. Andreessen grinned, appreciating the paradox: the more they paid for Mixpanel according to Thiel, anyway the better a deal they d be getting.  Most businesses don t work like this. At least, not yet.  Silicon Valley, the fifteen-hundred- square-mile shelf an hour south of San Francisco, was called the Santa Clara Valley until the rise of the microprocessor, in the nineteen-seventies. It remains contested ground. Armies of startups attack every incumbent, with early employees and sometimes even their lawyers and landlords taking deferred compensation, in the hope that their options and warrants will pay off down the line. Yet workers  loyalty is not to a company or even to an idea but to the iterative promise of the region.  Uber is built on the efforts of thousands of people in the Valley,  the investor Naval Ravikant said.  On the back of the iPhone and Android and G.P.S. and battery technology and online credit-card payments, all stacked on themselves.   V.C.s give the Valley its continuity and its ammunition. They are the arms merchants who can turn your crazy idea and your expendable youth into a team of coders with Thunderbolt monitors. Apple and Microsoft got started with venture money; so did Starbucks, the Home Depot, Whole Foods Market, and JetBlue. V.C.s made their key introductions and stole from every page of Sun Tzu to help them penetrate markets. And yet V.C.s maintain a zone of embarrassed privacy around their activities. They tell strangers they re investors, or work in technology, because, in a Valley that valorizes the entrepreneur, they don t want to be seen as just the money.  I say I m in the software industry,  one of the Valley s best-known V.C.s told me.  I m ashamed of the truth.   At a hundred and eleven dollars a square foot, Sand Hill Road is America s most expensive office-rental market an oak-and-eucalyptus-lined prospect stippled with bland, two-story ski chalets constrained by an ethos of nonconspicuous consumption (except for the Teslas in the parking lot). It s a community of paranoid optimists. The top firms co perate and compete by turns, suspicious of any company whose previous round wasn t led by another top-five firm even as they re jealous of that firm for leading it. They call this Schadenfreude-riddled relationship  co-opitition.  Firms trumpet their boldness, yet they often follow one another, lemming-like, pursuing the latest innovation pen-based computers, biotech, interactive television, superconductors, clean tech off a cliff.  Venture capital became a profession here when an investor named Arthur Rock bankrolled Intel, in 1968. Intel s co-founder Gordon Moore coined the phrase  vulture capital,  because V.C.s could pick you clean. Semiretired millionaires who routinely arrived late for pitch meetings, they d take half your company and replace you with a C.E.O. of their choosing if you were lucky. But V.C.s can also anoint you. The imprimatur of a top firm s investment is so powerful that entrepreneurs routinely accept a twenty-five per cent lower valuation to get it. Patrick Collison, a co-founder of the online-payment company Stripe, says that landing Sequoia, Peter Thiel, and a16z as seed investors  was a signal that was not lost on the banks we wanted to work with.  Laughing, he noted that the valuation in the next round of funding for a pre-launch company from very untested entrepreneurs who had very few customers was a hundred million dollars. Stewart Butterfield, a co-founder of the office-messaging app Slack, told me,  It s hard to overestimate how much the perception of the quality of the V.C. firm you re with matters the signal it sends to other V.C.s, to potential employees, to customers, to the tech press. It s like where you went to college.   A venture firm musters its ammunition say, a fund of a hundred and fifty million dollars by recruiting investors such as university endowments and pension funds to become  limited partners,  or L.P.s, in the fund. The firm invests the money for three or four years, then harvests the returns for the remainder of the fund s ten-year term. In theory, V.C.s, like entrepreneurs, are motivated by delayed gratification. The standard fee is  two and twenty : two per cent of the fund each year, and twenty per cent of the ultimate profits. (The top firms, including a16z, charge thirty per cent.) L.P.s expect returns equal to at least those they d get in the stock market, plus an additional five per cent for the illiquidity of the investment. For top firms, the dream is 5x to 10x.  At the moment, venture funding accounts for less than 0.3 per cent of the U.S. s G.D.P.  Venture is often called a rounding error in the economy,  Herbert Allen III, the head of the investment bank Allen & Company, said.  But the bang for the buck is huge. And venture is a major source of the optimism that underlies the American myth.  Venture speeds the cycle of American impatience: what exists is bad and what replaces it is good until the new thing itself must be supplanted.  Corporate culture, civic responsibility, becoming a pillar of society these are not venture s concerns. Andy Weissman, a partner at New York s Union Square Ventures, noted that venture in the Valley is a perfect embodiment of the capitalist dynamic that the economist Joseph Schumpeter called  creative destruction.  Weissman said,  Silicon Valley V.C.s are all techno-optimists. They have the arrogant belief that you can take a geography and remove all obstructions and have nothing but a free flow of capital and ideas, and that it s good, it s very good, to creatively destroy everything that has gone before.  Some Silicon Valley V.C.s believe that these values would have greater sway if their community left America behind: Andreessen s nerd nation with a charter and a geographic locale. Peter Thiel favors  seasteading,  establishing floating cities in the middle of the ocean. Balaji Srinivasan, until recently a general partner at a16z and now the chairman of one of its Bitcoin companies, has called for the  ultimate exit.  Arguing that the United States is as fossilized as Microsoft, and that the Valley has become stronger than Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., combined, Srinivasan believes that its denizens should  build an opt-in society, ultimately outside the U.S., run by technology.   The game in Silicon Valley, while it remains part of California, is not ferocious intelligence or a contrarian investment thesis: everyone has that. It s not even wealth: anyone can become a billionaire just by rooming with Mark Zuckerberg. It s prescience. And then it s removing every obstacle to the ferocious clarity of your vision: incumbents, regulations, folkways, people. Can you not just see the future but summon it?  Marc Andreessen mentions Thomas Edison often, his family never. When he was growing up, outside the no-stoplight town of New Lisbon, Wisconsin, his father, Lowell, was a sales manager for a seed company called Pioneer Hi-Bred International, and his mother, Pat, worked in customer service at Lands  End but I didn t get that information from him. A friend who knows Andreessen well told me,  We ve never had a conversation about his parents or his brother all he said was  They didn t like me, and I didn t like them all that much, either.     The few details Andreessen let slip to me suggested a climate of antiquity, superstition, frustration, and penury.  The natural state of human beings is to be subsistence farmers, and that was my expectation,  he said, adding that his world was  Scandinavian, hard-core, very self-denying people who go through life never expecting to be happy.  The family telephone was a party line, and the bathroom at his relatives  farm was an outhouse. Everyone believed in dowsing and the weather reports in the Farmers  Almanac. One winter, with money tight, his father decided to stop paying for gas heat,  and we spent a great deal of time chopping fucking wood.  The local movie theatre, one town over, was an unheated room that doubled as a fertilizer-storage depot; Andreessen wore a puffy Pioneer Hi-Bred coat to watch  Star Wars  while sitting on the makings of a huge bomb. He had to drive an hour to find a Waldenbooks, in La Crosse; it was all cookbooks and cat calendars. So he later saw Amazon as a heroic disseminator of knowledge and progress.  Screw the independent bookstores,  he told me.  There weren t any near where I grew up. There were only ones in college towns. The rest of us could go pound sand.   Andreessen s vision of the future, and of his escape route, came from television. He told me,   KITT , the car in  Knight Rider,  was a computer that could analyze a poison-gas attack. The car was magic but now you can actually do all those things. A new car isn t KITT , but it does have all the maps and all the music in the world, and it talks to you. Even the transporter beam in  Star Trek  basically makes sense if you understand quantum entanglement. People are composed of quantum elements, so there is a path!   Something of the transporter beam clings to Andreessen, a sense that he just rematerialized from a city on the edge of forever. He s not great at the basics of daily life: directions confound him, because roadways aren t logical, and he s so absent-minded about sunglasses that he keeps a  reload station  with nine pairs on his hall table. Perhaps Edison haunts his conversation because Andreessen is a fellow-tinkerer, except that his gadgets are systems and platforms, and his workshop is his own mind. He regularly reprograms his appearance and deportment his user interface to suit his present role, and friends refer to chapters in his life as versions of an operating system:  Marc 1.0,   Marc 2.0,  and so on. A charismatic introvert, Andreessen draws people in but doesn t really want them around. Though he has a crisp sense of humor, it s rarely deployed at his own expense. He hates being complimented, looked at, or embraced, and has toyed with the idea of wearing a T-shirt that says  No hugging, no touching.  He doesn t grasp the protocols of social chitchat, and prefers getting a memo to which he can e-mail a response, typing at a hundred and forty words a minute. He didn t attend Netscape s twentieth-anniversary celebration, because it combined two things from which he recoils: parties and reminiscing.  Yet he s also energetic and decisive, which makes him a valued counsellor. In 2006, Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for a billion dollars, and Accel Partners, Facebook s lead investor, urged Mark Zuckerberg to accept. Andreessen said,  Every single person involved in Facebook wanted Mark to take the Yahoo! offer. The psychological pressure they put on this twenty-two-year-old was intense. Mark and I really bonded in that period, because I told him,  Don t sell, don t sell, don t sell!    Zuckerberg told me,  Marc has this really deep belief that when companies are executing well on their vision they can have a much bigger effect on the world than people think, not just as a business but as a steward of humanity if they have the time to execute.  He didn t sell; Facebook is now worth two hundred and eighteen billion dollars.  Andreessen s range of reference extends from Ibn Khaldun to  South Park,  yet he approaches new topics as if starved, eating through men s fashion or whiskey-making or congressional politics until it has yielded every micronutrient. In a tweetstorm about the question of net neutrality, he observed that anyone who took a position should be versed in the  history, technology, and economics of backbones, interconnection agreement, peering, CDNs, caching, colocation, current and future telco and cable business models including capex and opex models, rate caps, cost of capital, return on investment,  as well as a dozen other equally abstruse matters. He coyly noted that no one, himself included, understood them all then stated his position. Andreessen s learning fuses the idiosyncrasy of the autodidact with the thoroughness of what programmers call depth-first search.  I could never tolerate not knowing why,  he said.  You have to work your way back to figure out the politics, the motivations. I always stop when I get to evolutionary psychology, and why we have tribes oh, O.K., we re primates cursed with emotions and the ability to do logical thinking.  He keeps rediscovering that we re australopithecines, and keeps hoping to transform us into Homo habilis: man the tool user, able man.  To this end, he addresses any topic, such as Google s purchase of the thermostat maker Nest, by launching a dialectics 1) Either Nest is the most amazing company ever, or 2) Larry Page acqui-hired Tony Fadell for $3.2 billion and got a thermostat business on the side whose synthesis is often that the thesis and the antithesis were simplistic ( Or, maybe Google has a larger plan for automating the home ) or irrelevant ( Whatever, whatever, we don t own it, so who cares? ). Often, he discourses at such lucid length that his cheeks redden and he must pause for breath. If you seize the interval to demonstrate a basic grasp of his argument, he ll say  Ex-zact-ly,  with a pleased smile, and upload another tranche. What saves him from pompous know-it-all-dom, most of the time, is this eagerness to communicate.  He turns to theory the way a drinker turns to the minibar. But Horowitz told me that every once in a while Andreessen will  get all Wisconsin on you, sticking up for his people. When we looked at an Internet pawnshop, people here said,  It s immoral,  and Marc went bananas. He said,  If you ve got no fucking money, and you need to pawn your watch to pay for your kids to eat you think that s morally fucking wrong because it offends your sensibilities, you rich motherfuckers?  He knew that guy who was pawning his watch because he d missed the harvest, or whatever. Or we saw an Uber-for-private-jets thing, or some wine thing that came through, and he just got incensed:  We didn t start the firm for rich people to buy hundred-dollar bottles of wine or to fly around on fucking private jets!  He reminds me of Kanye, that level of emotional intensity his childhood was so intensely bad he just won t go there.   One afternoon, Alexis Ringwald, the C.E.O. of LearnUp, a job-training startup that has worked with Staples and Old Navy, stood in a16z s conference room, all poise and smile.  I like to launch movements to tackle huge problems,  she said, launching into her presentation.   Start at the beginning, where you grew up,  Ben Horowitz said. A16z had made a small seed investment in Ringwald s company, but most of the general partners, who were about to tell her whether she was ready for an A round, didn t know much about her. Horowitz also routinely forces a founder to abandon her script and regroup. It s a stress test intended to elicit biography, resilience, and the real story.  Ringwald, who is thirty-one, blinked, then shifted smoothly to an engaging account of her early years, her work interviewing people on the unemployment line, and how she d eventually realized that the country s biggest gulf is between those who have the basic skills to be employable showing up on time, dressing neatly and those who don t.  So it s a modern  My Fair Lady  sort of thing?  Horowitz asked, ingenuously. Ringwald crisply noted that her process triples an applicant s chance of getting a job, and that eighty-two per cent of LearnUp s trainees outperform their fellow-workers. Horowitz and Andreessen nodded: she could handle the pressure. Afterward, Horowitz told me,  My big conclusion was she s a legit Pied Piper, with charisma and will and fury.   Pitch meetings are minefields. If a V.C. asks you,  When you get to a hundred engineers, are you worried about the company culture or excited?,  the correct answer is  A hundred? I want a thousand!  Reid Hoffman, a V.C. at Greylock Partners who co-founded LinkedIn, told me,  I look to see if someone has a marine strategy, for taking the beach; an army strategy, for taking the country; and a police strategy, for governing the country afterward.   A16z wants to learn if the founder has a secret a novel insight, drawn from personal experience, about how the world could be better arranged. If that new arrangement is 10x better, consumers might be won over. Balaji Srinivasan contributed the concept of the  idea maze : you want the entrepreneur to have spent years thinking her idea into and out of every conceivable dead end.  Entrepreneurs want to raise money from us,  Andreessen told me,  so the natural thing when we say  What if you did this?  is to tell us what we want to hear. But we don t want to hear what we want to hear. It s a delight when they look at you with contempt You idiot and then walk you through the idea maze and explain why your idea won t work.  Such tests help a16z determine whether the founder is a mercenary who wants to sell the company within four years, which will cap a16z s return at 5x, or a missionary, determined to change the world.  At the same time,  Andreessen said,  we re not funding Mother Teresa. We re funding imperial, will-to-power people who want to crush their competition. Companies can only have a big impact on the world if they get big.   Ringwald, back into her planned remarks, promised bigness:  LearnUp will transform employment in America. We can unleash human potential and move the needle on the G.D.P.  Andreessen said,  Question: This is a known problem. Why do companies not just do this themselves, once they see that it works?  Ringwald replied,  We ll keep on differentiating by moving fast and collecting more data on what companies need now.   Then a general partner named Chris Dixon asked,  Is it a marketplace or an enterprise company?  Marketplace companies sell to consumers; enterprise companies sell to other businesses. Clearly perplexed by the distinction, Ringwald said that she was signing up workers as well as companies. Everyone became a shade more remote.  Afterward, Andreessen told his colleagues,  She didn t really answer Chris s question. If it s marketplace, it s defensible; if it s enterprise, she can be undercut.  If Ringwald s customers were the workers, who would keep using LearnUp as they moved from job to job, she could create a network effect. If her customers were actually the companies, they could start doing the training themselves or another startup could. A16z views marketplace and enterprise companies very differently. The firm invests early with enterprise, but waits with consumer companies, because they tend to take off suddenly, everyone wants to be on Instagram or fail fast. It s a risk-averse way to embrace risk. In 2013, a16z passed on the A round of Oculus VR (waiting to see if it could resolve the nausea issue that has plagued virtual-reality systems) and came in on the B, six months later. It got the same ten per cent of the company it could have had in the A but it paid thirty million dollars instead of six million. The internal rationale for this expensive  de-risking  is  We paid up for certainty.   The partners began to discuss how LearnUp might be valued. Valuation, particularly in a company s early rounds, often derives less from spreadsheets than from market forces what are other firms offering? and the  What if s of mental modelling. Does the company s traction, leadership team, and  total addressable market  call to mind a Pinterest, or does it feel more like a ShoeDazzle? One partner suggested that LearnUp was a  ten on thirty ten million dollars should buy a third of the company, which would then be valued at forty million.  It s more like ten on fifteen or twenty,  Horowitz said, cutting the company s value in half.  Or six on twelve,  Andreessen said, whittling it further. Soon after the meeting, Ringwald turned LearnUp into an enterprise company.  Most venture firms operate as a guild; each partner works with his own companies, and a small shared staff helps with business development and recruiting. A16z introduced a new model: the venture company. Its general partners make about three hundred thousand dollars a year, far less than the industry standard of at least a million dollars, and the savings pays for sixty-five specialists in executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing. A16z maintains a network of twenty thousand contacts and brings two thousand established companies a year to its executive briefing center to meet its startups (which has produced a pipeline of deals worth three billion dollars). Andreessen told me,  We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years.   The firm s fourteen-person deal team also enables it to rapidly assess any new technology, making a16z a kind of Iron Man suit for Andreessen as he pursues his flights of fancy. Jim Breyer, who led Facebook s first venture round at Accel Partners, told me,  I spend most of my time trying to connect the dots for what the future will look like in five to seven years, but I don t believe I scale as well as Marc and Ben and their team. They ve moved into next-gen agricultural products and wearables and drone software, where a lot of us don t have expertise or networks.   Andreessen and Horowitz launched the firm in 2009, when venture investment was frozen by the recession. Their strategy was shaped by their friend Andy Rachleff, a former V.C. He told them that he d run the numbers and that fifteen technology companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in annual revenue and they account for ninety-eight per cent of the market capitalization of companies that go public. So a16z had to get those fifteen companies to pitch them.  Deal flow is everything,   Andreessen told me.  If you re in a second-tier firm, you never get a chance at that great company.  A leading investment banker who has taken numerous software companies public told me,  I put ninety per cent of my effort into seeking out deals from the top eight venture firms, ten per cent into the next twelve, and zero per cent into all the rest.   The dirty secret of the trade is that the bottom three-quarters of venture firms didn t beat the Nasdaq for the past five years. In a stinging 2012 report, the L.P. Diane Mulcahy calculated,  Since 1997, less cash has been returned to V.C. investors than they have invested.  The truth is that most V.C.s subsist entirely on fees, which they compound by raising a new fund every three years. Returns are kept hidden by nondisclosure agreements, and so V.C.s routinely overstate them, both to encourage investment and to attract entrepreneurs.  You can t find a venture fund anywhere that s not in the top quartile,  one L.P. said sardonically. V.C.s also logo shop, buying into late rounds of hot companies at high prices so they can list them on their portfolio page.  When a16z began, it didn t have even an ersatz track record to promote. So Andreessen and Horowitz consulted on tactics with their friend Michael Ovitz, who co-founded the Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency, in 1974. Ovitz told me that he d advised them to distinguish themselves by treating the entrepreneur as a client:  Take the long view of your platform, rather than a transactional one. Call everyone a partner, offer services the others don t, and help people who aren t your clients. Disrupt to differentiate by becoming a dream-execution machine.   Believing that founders make the best C.E.O.s look at Intel, Apple, Oracle, Google, Facebook Andreessen and Horowitz recruited only general partners who d been founders or run companies. Then they began constructing the illusion of authority, taking offices on Sand Hill Road and filling them with paintings by Robert Rauschenberg and Sol LeWitt another page from the book of Ovitz, who commissioned a Roy Lichtenstein painting for C.A.A. s lobby that was so large the firm had to leave it behind when it moved. They were studiously punctual (partners are fined ten dollars for each minute they re late to a pitch), used glassware rather than plastic, and said no quickly and explained why (unless the reason was doubts about the entrepreneur) in a handwritten note. And, while most V.C.s were publicity averse Sequoia s slogan was  The entrepreneurs behind the entrepreneurs a16z banged the drum to draw startups. The tech publicist Margit Wennmachers built an eight-person marketing department and helped to orchestrate stories in Forbes and Fortune.  Andreessen and Horowitz believed that it would take them years to get great deal flow. So instead of fighting for A-round financings the most competitive round, because it s when you can buy the largest chunk of an up-and-coming company they planned to make seed investments in eighty startups. They wouldn t take the customary board seats (otherwise, they d each be sitting on forty boards), but they d help all eighty companies and then lead the A round for the twelve best.  The strategy had flaws. Entrepreneurs want V.C.s on their boards, and so do L.P.s: that s how you really learn a company. The firm would be sending a huge negative signal about companies it didn t reinvest in hardly an entrepreneur-friendly stance. Furthermore, by making so many investments, a16z would create significant opportunity costs. In its first year, it put two hundred and fifty thousand dollars into a company called Burbn, which soon pivoted and became Instagram but a16z couldn t increase its share, because it had also taken a position in a short-lived photo app called PicPlz. Though the firm made 312x when Facebook bought Instagram, the huge multiple amounted to only seventy-eight million dollars. Elizabeth Obershaw, a managing director at Horsley Bridge, a prominent L.P. that invested in a16z after some debate, told me,  Our list of cons was that we didn t think their original model would work at all. The pros were Marc and Ben we decided they were learners and adapters and would realize the model wasn t workable fast enough to fix it and an industry that was ripe for reinvention.   They learned fast. After a16z raised a three-hundred-million-dollar fund and opened shop, in July, 2009, it did a lot of seed rounds, but it also spent fifty million dollars to buy three per cent of Skype. Two years later, Microsoft bought Skype, and the investment returned 4x. Andreessen believed that everyone had underestimated the size of the Internet market, so in 2010, after raising a much bigger second fund, the firm spent a hundred and thirty million dollars to acquire shares of Facebook and Twitter at unprecedented valuations. Other V.C.s sniped that a16z was trying to buy its way in: Skype was an established company, not a startup, and the Facebook and Twitter deals were mere logo shopping. But, as Ron Conway, Silicon Valley s leading angel investor, noted,  In twenty-four months, Andreessen Horowitz was the talk of the town.  The firm won a hundred-million-dollar A round for the coding company GitHub, which Conway called  the most hotly contested deal in five years.  Chris Wanstrath, GitHub s co-founder and C.E.O., said that a16z s services were a major attraction:  It s like a buffet they offered a bunch of great dishes, and we wanted to sample them all.   After six years, Andreessen believes, a16z is meeting and winning enough new clients to place it  comfortably in the top three  V.C. firms. (This is not far off from the consensus in the Valley.) Its first fund has already returned 2x, and contains such powerhouses as Slack and the identity-management company Okta. The fund s internal rate of return, a calculation of annualized profit, is fifty per cent, which places it very high among funds raised in 2009. (Sequoia s rate for its corresponding fund is sixty-nine per cent.) The firm s second fund includes Pinterest and Airbnb, and its third fund includes Zenefits, GitHub, and Mixpanel; both funds, on paper, are well into the black. A respected L.P. of the firm told me,  They re one of our top performers.  Yet Andreessen cautioned,  We still have a lot to prove on returns. I wouldn t be comfortable saying we re No. 1 until ten years have passed, maybe fifteen. Until then, it s Schr dinger s cat, and I ve got really good arguments on why the cats are both alive and dead.   At Andreessen s wedding, in 2006, Ben Horowitz said in his toast that the man he d long known was  grouchy Marc,  because he d  gone through his whole life without anyone understanding him, being all by himself.  No one had understood him in his farm town, no one had understood him in Silicon Valley Hell, I do not understand him.  But now, at last, he was  happy Marc,  because he d found  someone who totally gets him : the bride, a lecturer in philanthropy at Stanford s business school named Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen.  In December, Andreessen invited me to their house in Atherton, five minutes from a16z s office, to watch television. He and Laura live in a modern, art-filled, nine-thousand-square-foot villa built in a style that she calls  Northern California pastiche.  The ceilings are scaled to Andreessen s Brobdingnagian proportions, and everything is majestic, minimal, and new. The toilet in the powder room is so visionary, and the surrounding dimmer lights so flattering, that I had to study it for some time to figure out how it flushed.  Arrillaga-Andreessen brought the couple s dinners into the living room and placed them on matching Costco TV tables. The omelettes and Thai salads that their chef had prepared earlier had been freshly reheated (they have three microwaves, so their food will always be ready at the same time). Andreessen stroked her arm and beamed:  Hello, gorgeous!    Hello, my darling!  she replied. Then she gave me a dramatic hug, as we hadn t seen each other since the previous day. Arrillaga-Andreessen is a tall, ethereal-seeming, yet effusive woman. When the couple met, in 2005, at a New Year s Eve dinner thrown by the leading investor in eHarmony, they talked for six and a half hours. She told me that Andreessen satisfied most of the criteria on her checklist: he was a genius, he was a coder, he was funny, and he was bald. ( I find it incredibly sexy to see the encasement of a cerebrum,  she explained.) For his part, Andreessen felt that  she was spectacular! My biggest concern was that she wanted to live a jet-set life.  In one of the seventeen e-mails he sent her the next day, he asked,  What s your ideal evening?  She responded,  Stay home, do e-mail, make an omelette, watch TV, take a bath, go to bed.  Before their second date, he delivered what she calls  a twenty-five-minute monologue on why we should go steady, with a full intellectual decision tree in anticipation of my own decision tree.  They were married nine months later. In her and her father, John, a billionaire Silicon Valley developer, Andreessen seems to have found a replacement family. Laura showed me a photograph of the two men side by side, both bald, self-made, and magisterial:  Quite two peas in a pod.   After some TV time together, the couple reads in bed, so that, she says,  I can fall asleep holding my beloved.  (She invariably refers to her husband as  my beloved,  rather than  Marc. )  I ask him questions about things I got curious about during the day, so every night I m going to sleep with a human Wikipedia that can go deeper and deeper and deeper, link upon link. In the past week, we talked about all the hardware components of a mobile phone, how binary code works, what might happen with drone regulation, and whether Putin is using Ukraine as a distraction from the financial crisis in Russia.  Once she s dozed off, Andreessen returns to work in his home office, where, like a recharging cell phone, he gains energy through the night.  He pushed a button to unroll the wall screen, then called up Apple TV. We were going to watch the final two episodes of the first season of the AMC drama  Halt and Catch Fire,  about a fictional company called Cardiff, which enters the personal-computer wars of the early eighties. The show s resonance for Andreessen was plain. In 1983, he said,  I was twelve, and I didn t know anything about startups or venture capital, but I knew all the products.  He used the school library s Radio Shack TRS-80 to build a calculator for math homework. In 1992, as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he neglected his job writing Unix code for $6.85 an hour to team with another programmer to create Mosaic, the first graphical browser for the Web. After graduating, he moved to Silicon Valley, where he and a volatile serial entrepreneur named Jim Clark launched Netscape, to make the Internet available not just to scientists but to everyone. John Doerr, the V.C. who funded their A round, said that the genius of their browser was that  it was like putting photos on the menu at Howard Johnson. You didn t need to know the language; you could just point.  The story underlying that story, Arrillaga-Andreessen told me the secret was that  Netscape was based on my beloved s own inability, as a child, to access knowledge in a small town.   Netscape Navigator, released in 1994, quickly claimed more than ninety per cent of the browser market, and Andreessen predicted that the Web would make operating systems such as Microsoft s Windows  irrelevant.  When the company went public, in 1995, its stock rocketed from twenty-eight dollars a share to seventy-five dollars, and Andreessen was soon on the cover of Time, barefoot on a throne. But Marc 1.0 was very much in beta. Having given up coding, his first love, to manage coders, he scarfed Pepperidge Farm Nantuckets and Honeycomb cereal straight from the box, skipped meetings, and blazed up without warning.  You d see him vibrating, and it would inspire a combination of excitement and terror,  Jason Rosenthal, a manager whom Andreessen actually liked, recalled. A favorite Andreessen response to underlings  confusion was  There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.  Jim Barksdale, the company s C.E.O., said,  I d tell Marc after meetings,  You don t have to tell a dumb sumbitch he s a dumb sumbitch.    Andreessen told me,  I needed Netscape to work, it had to work it was my one-way door so I was absolutely intolerant of anything that got in the way meaning, he clarified,  people.  He could never relax:  I am very paranoid. And the down cycle hurt a lot more than the up cycle felt good.   The down cycle began when Microsoft bundled its own browser with its operating system, making it the nation s browser of convenience, if not of choice. Netscape shifted from marketplace to enterprise, and began selling browser and server software, but it was fortunate to get bought by AOL, in 1999, for ten billion dollars. Peter Currie, the company s C.F.O., said,  We made a difference, we invented cookies and pioneered downloading software from the Internet, yet Netscape is an asterisk in business history. Maybe the best way to think about it is as a classic tech story: a company creates, invents, succeeds and gets bypassed.   In the first  Halt and Catch Fire  episode, Cardiff s entrepreneurs go to Comdex, the big trade show, and discover that another company has stolen their idea and beaten them to market. In response, Gordon, the hardware engineer, removes the interactive operating system from their Cardiff machine a system designed by Cameron, a punk female software prodigy and slots in Microsoft s dos , which makes the machine I.B.M.-compatible, viable, and dull. It was an excruciating capitulation, but Andreessen nodded evenly:  This was Microsoft s moment, and Gordon is right they need to live to fight another day. But . . .  He pointed at the screen, where Apple s Macintosh was making its d but at the trade show.  Hello, I m Macintosh,  the machine said. Andreessen laughed and continued,  They were doomed from the start, because Apple in Cupertino in Silicon Valley had spent three years building that. I ve been totally determined to be on the other side of that dynamic by being here, because success in software follows a power-law distribution. It s not Coke and Pepsi and a bunch of others; it s winner take all. Second prize is a set of steak knives, and third prize is you re fired.   In the season finale, Cameron launches her own startup. As Andreessen watched her manage her coders, he said, softly,  The best scenes with Cameron were when she was alone in the basement, coding.  I said I felt that she was the least satisfactory character: underwritten, inconsistent, lacking in plausible motivation. He smiled and replied,  Because she s the future.   In  Why Software Is Eating the World,  a widely invoked 2011 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Andreessen put the most optimistic spin on Silicon Valley s tendencies. The article proclaimed that tech companies are consuming vast swaths of the economy, from books and movies to financial services to agriculture to national defense which Andreessen saw as the healthful scavenging of a carrion way of life. On Twitter, he pursued the theme:  Posit a world in which all material needs are provided free, by robots and material synthesizers. . . . Imagine six, or 10, billion people doing nothing but arts and sciences, culture and exploring and learning. What a world that would be,  particularly as  technological progress is precisely what makes a strong, rigorous social safety net affordable.   Andreessen s telepathic method extrapolating the future from current trends may be the best available, but it has had doubtful results. Of the eighteen firms that V.C.s valued at more than a billion dollars in the heady days of 1999-2000, eleven have gone out of business or have been liquidated in fire sales, including @Home, eToys, and Webvan. A16z bought into Zulily, an online marketer, at a valuation of a billion dollars; it soared to a market capitalization of five billion dollars, and has since slumped to $1.3 billion. Another billion-dollar a16z company, the bargain-shopping site Fab, recently sold for about thirty million dollars. On the other hand, the firm wrote off the gaming company Slack to zero and then it became an office-messaging app that s now valued at $2.8 billion.  The random, contingent way that the future comes to pass is a source of endless frustration in the Valley. Sam Altman, the president of the startup incubator Y Combinator, notes that his early investment in Stripe is now worth, on paper, more than 2,000x.  So ninety-seven per cent of my returns from 2010 and 2011 are concentrated in one investment, which I could easily have missed,  he said.  I only let myself think about this sort of thing on vacation, because if I acknowledged that I was wasting more than ninety per cent of my time which is true, from an economic perspective I couldn t get through my days.   The key to investing, Andreessen contends, is to be aggressive and to fight your instinct to pattern-match.  Breakthrough ideas look crazy, nuts,  he said, adding,  It s hard to think this way I see it in other people s body language, and I can feel it in my own, where I sometimes feel like I don t even care if it s going to work, I can t take more change.  Andreessen believes that the major barrier to change is sociological: people can embrace only so many new ideas at once.  O.K., Google, O.K., Twitter but Airbnb? People staying in each other s houses without there being a lot of axe murders?   A16z passed on Airbnb s A round in 2009. Reid Hoffman, the Greylock V.C., who led that round, and who is a friend of Andreessen s, said,  Once something like Airbnb gets going, Marc can get a very good sense of it, of the economic system but he s not necessarily as good at the psychology of why it would get going in the first place.   Brian Chesky, Airbnb s co-founder and C.E.O., told me,  In 2011, when we were starting to get some traction, Marc and Ben did a one-eighty and were very humble. Marc said he now saw it through the lens of eBay: buying stuff from strangers.  A16z led Airbnb s B round. Soon afterward, the company was battered by headlines about renters who trashed a San Francisco home. It wasn t axe murders, but, Chesky said,  It was a P.R. nightmare. We had just expanded from being ten people living in a three-bedroom apartment and we had no idea how to be a billion-dollar company. Marc came to our office at midnight and read the letter I d written to our community about the Airbnb Guarantee, and the two changes he made changed the company forever. I d said we guarantee five thousand dollars for property damage, and he added a zero, which seemed crazy.  Andreessen also added the proviso that claimants would have to file a police report, which he correctly believed would discourage scam artists.  And he told me to add my personal e-mail address. He gave us permission to be bold.   In venture, it s not batting average that matters; it s slugging average. Boldness is all. When Google Glass appeared, a16z joined a collective to seek out investments, and Andreessen declared that, without the face shield,  people are going to find they feel, basically, naked and lonely.  Google withdrew the product in January. But, he would argue, so what? His thesis is that such a16z failures as Fab and Rockmelt and Digg and Kno are not merely a tolerable by-product of the risk algorithm but a vital indicator of it. It s fine to have a lousy record of predicting the future, most of the time, as long as when you re right you re really right. Between 2004 and 2013, a mere 0.4 per cent of all venture investments returned at least 50x. The real mistakes aren t the errors of commission, the companies that crash all you can lose is your investment but those of omission. There were good reasons that a16z passed on buying twelve per cent of Uber in 2011, including a deadline of just hours to make a decision. But the firm missed a profit, on paper, of more than three billion dollars.  The beauty of betting on risky technologies is that you re sometimes proved right, eventually perhaps we ll all feel naked without Google Glass 3.0. When reverses occur, Andreessen tends to believe that he wasn t wrong so much as overly prescient. Yet, while he professes intellectual comfort with being wrong, he never mentions Ning, a social-networking company that he co-founded in 2004, because, as he conceded when I asked about the elision,  It didn t do great.  And he can be touchy about criticism. At one Q. & A. I attended, when the interviewer read him a snarky quote from Sam Biddle, a writer who worked for the gossip site Valleywag, Andreessen made a doobie-smoking gesture and plunged an imaginary needle into his vein to suggest the quality of Biddle s thinking. Being the public face of venture means that you can be challenged on multiple fronts: even as you philosophize about ushering in a new age of democracy, you also have to make money for your L.P.s. And, while the ideal startup advances both goals, most, in truth, advance neither. The V.C. Bryce Roberts told me,  It s an ego game, where you want to believe you re changing the world. But how can you write a check to Fab and believe that giving people discounted tchotchkes is changing the world?   In 1999, Andreessen and Horowitz started Loudcloud, an early cloud-computing service that booked thirty-seven million dollars in contracts in its first nine months. Andreessen, meanwhile, was becoming Marc 2.0. He shed thirty pounds, started wearing Ermenegildo Zegna suits, and traded in his red Mustang for a white Mercedes.  Marc 1.0 was Jim Clark,  Andreessen told me, referring to his impulsive co-founder.  Marc 2.0 was trying to get as polished as possible, more socialized. And Marc 3.0 is a combo. The goal is not to be elegant but to be blunt enough that there s no confusion. I learned the skills from reading all of Caro s L.B.J. books.   The dot-com crash hit Loudcloud hard, and, in 2002, it pivoted to become a software company with a new name: Opsware. In 2007, after years of slogging, Andreessen and Horowitz sold the company for $1.6 billion. Andreessen says that the tech crash scarred him:  The overwhelming message to our generation in the early nineties was  You re dirty, you re all about grunge you guys are fucking losers!  Then the tech boom hit, and it was  We are going to do amazing things!  And then the roof caved in, and the wisdom was that the Internet was a mirage. I one hundred per cent believed that, because the rejection was so personal both what everybody thought of me and what I thought of myself. I was not depressed, but I was growly. In retrospect,  he concluded,  we were five or six years too early.   Peter Thiel, who is four years older than Andreessen, observed that  the late nineties, for Gen Xers in Silicon Valley, was an experience as powerful as the late sixties was for the younger boomers. The sixties was a transformative moment that got short-circuited by Nixon, and, for Marc, the nineties when Netscape was iconic, and he was deeply living the belief that technology was going to inspire liberalization everywhere was short-circuited by the super-powerful bust and return of the old economy. But Marc is very tenacious.   Andreessen said he learned that, while technology improves steadily,  psychologically there s no middle ground the plane is always headed straight up or straight down.  Recognizing that he was a poor manager, and needing to buffer those emotional and financial swings, Andreessen saw that the obvious next move was a portfolio of investments. In 2003, he and Horowitz began angel investing, separately and then together; they put ten million dollars into fifty companies, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Then Andreessen began pushing to start a venture firm.  I always thought the entire venture thing was incredibly cool,  he told me.  Going to Kleiner Perkins the firm that funded Netscape with the high ceilings, the markers on the wall of all the great companies they d I.P.O. d, Larry Ellison walking through, and, at 11 a.m. , the biggest buffet you ve ever seen, at a time when I was eating at Subway? It was the closest thing to a cathedral for nerds.  Mark Zuckerberg told me,  When Marc started Andreessen Horowitz, I asked him why he didn t start another company instead, and he said,  It would be like going back to kindergarten.     A16z was designed not merely to succeed but also to deliver payback: it would right the wrongs that Andreessen and Horowitz had suffered as entrepreneurs. Most of those, in their telling, came from Benchmark Capital, the firm that funded Loudcloud, and recently led the A rounds of Uber and Snapchat a five-partner boutique with no back-office specialists to provide the services they d craved.  We were always the anti-Benchmark,  Horowitz told me.  Our design was to not do what they did.  Horowitz is still mad that one Benchmark partner asked him, in front of his co-founders,  When are you going to get a real C.E.O.?  And that Benchmark s best-known V.C., the six-feet-eight Bill Gurley, another outspoken giant with a large Twitter following, advised Horowitz to cut Andreessen and his six-million-dollar investment out of the company. Andreessen said,  I can t stand him. If you ve seen  Seinfeld,  Bill Gurley is my Newman Jerry s b te noire.  A16z s services model made a strong impression on Sand Hill Road.  Andreessen caused us to up our game on the marketing side,  Sequoia s Doug Leone told me.  Younger founders pay attention to media, and we don t want to be de-positioned.  Sequoia hired an in-house publicist and two new marketing specialists to complement the four it had, and most top firms made similar moves, even if they privately believed that a16z s services were simply a marketing tool. Todd McKinnon, the C.E.O. of Okta, said,  Every firm we talk to now is  Hey, we re doing all this recruiting, and we ll introduce you to big customers.  It s become the table stakes.   Benchmark, by contrast, took down its Web site.  It s like watching Coke and Pepsi go head to head,  one C.E.O. told me. Bill Gurley declined my requests for comment, but he has publicly bemoaned all the money that firms such as a16z are pumping into the system at a time when he and many other V.C.s worry that the tech sector is experiencing another bubble. So many investors from outside the Valley want in on the startup world that valuations have been soaring: last year, thirty-eight U.S. startups received billion-dollar valuations, twenty-three more than in 2013. Many V.C.s have told their companies to raise as much money as possible now, to have a buffer against a crash.  Benchmark s funds top out at four hundred million dollars and are reserved for early-round investing: the original, artisanal venture model. A16z raised $1.5 billion each for its third and fourth funds, in 2012 and 2014, with much of the money earmarked for later, costlier growth rounds, whose returns tend to be capped at 5x. Andreessen argues that startups now wait longer and raise more capital before going public, and a16z wants to be in those conversations, too. He also says that larger funds will allow the firm to provide even more of the services that its entrepreneurs crave. But, in the Valley, increasing your fund size so dramatically is customarily seen as  smoking your own exhaust,  or, among those with a classical turn of mind, hubris.  Venture doesn t scale,  Diane Mulcahy, the L.P. and venture critic, said.  Raising and investing more doesn t increase the number of billion-dollar companies, and offering services to entrepreneurs won t help the firm generate returns. It s like a Saks Fifth Avenue that gives everybody a free iPhone. Are they going to attract everybody and see everybody? Yes. Are they going to make money? Not for long.   When I pressed Andreessen on a16z s fund size, he said that even if the basic assumptions haven t changed even if only fifteen companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in revenue those companies generate more money now. And, he said,  I d bet the number of companies that reach that revenue is going up.  With a playful smile, he referred to Gurley:  If there s no profit opportunity beyond the first four hundred million, Bill s making the case that everyone who follows Benchmark in a later investment round is a moron. I wouldn t say that.   One morning, as I sat down to breakfast with Andreessen, a rival V.C. sent me a long e-mail about a16z s holdings. The V.C. estimated that because Andreessen s firm had taken so many growth positions, its average ownership stake was roughly 7.5 per cent (it s eight per cent), which meant that to get 5x to 10x across its four funds  you would need your aggregate portfolio to be worth $240-$480B!  You would, in other words, need to invest in every Facebook and Uber that came along. When I started to check the math with Andreessen, he made a jerking-off motion and said  Blah-blah-blah. We have all the models we re elephant hunting, going after big game!   In addition to assuaging various slights from V.C.s, Andreessen is attempting to assuage the wound of the 2000 crash, by maintaining that it was an isolated event.  The argument in favor of concern is cyclical,  he told me busts follow booms.  The counterargument is that stuff works now. In 2000, you had fifty million people on the Internet, and the number of smartphones was zero. Today, you have three billion Internet users and two billion smartphones. It s Pong versus Nintendo. It s Carlota Perez s argument that technology is adopted on an S curve: the installation phase, the crash because the technology isn t ready yet and then the deployment phase, when technology gets adopted by everyone and the real money gets made.  So the 2000 tech crash prefigured not the next crash but a sustained boom. And Andreessen s portfolio, like the entire Sand Hill Road enterprise, wasn t so much overpriced as underappreciated.  Still, he recently tweeted that startups were spending too much. When the market turns, he wrote,  nobody will want to buy your cash-incinerating startup. There will be no Plan B. vaporize .  And, come to think of it, maybe it wasn t prudent to raise too much, either. In one pitch meeting where a portfolio company sought a billion-dollar growth round, Andreessen raised his arms overhead and made an explosive sound to warn of what can happen when your valuation vastly exceeds your revenues:  Thanks for playing game over!  The company went on to secure its round, with only a token contribution from a16z. Andreessen later said that, as in an increasing number of deals, growth investors had paid one round ahead of progress paid in other words, for the results they hoped to see in the following round. Though the company s lofty valuation buoyed a16z s portfolio, his body language suggested that buying at such valuations was maybe not smart but, as long as they re sophisticated investors, it s not our job to moralize on whether they re overpaying.   Another way of framing the growth-funding question, Peter Thiel suggests, is that Andreessen may not be as suited to making early, counterintuitive investments as he is a point that Andreessen concedes:  Peter is just smarter than I am, and in a lateral way.  But, Thiel says, Andreessen is well positioned, because of his broad knowledge and flexible mind-set, to respond to incremental changes in an array of fields. And that, he argues, is what the times reward:  While Twitter is a lesser innovation than flying cars, it s a much more valuable business. We live in a financial age, not a technological age.   In December, Apoorva Mehta, the founder of a grocery-delivery app called Instacart, came to a16z to ask it to fill out his C round. The firm had led Mehta s B round with an investment of twenty-seven million dollars, but he reminded the team anyway that Instacart  is quite a magical experience.  Then he invoked a few sharing-economy shibboleths, including  we don t have any infrastructure,   mobile-powered independent contractors,  and  machine-learning-based fulfillment engine.  In two years, Mehta had set up in fifteen cities, signed up many of the independent grocery chains, including Whole Foods, and showed profitability in a number of stores. And it was a defensible network, because he installed refrigerated lockers in the stores. At the same time, because Mehta had recently changed his model, Instacart was losing money on each delivery, and that amount was growing as he rapidly expanded into new markets.  Andreessen applied a disinfecting wipe and said,  Let me ask you a question I know the answer to. In 1999, there was no more flaming debacle of a business than grocery delivery online. You were probably twelve at the time of Webvan?    Thirteen,  Mehta said.   So why now?    The main reason is you have access to labor through smartphones. It s the same reason Uber and Lyft exist now.   Andreessen nodded with satisfaction:  You can orchestrate the entire supply chain through your phone.  Webvan was what he called a  ghost story a cautionary tale that still frightened investors. But Instacart proved that even haunted houses could be rehabilitated.  Another partner asked about competitors, including Uber, TaskRabbit, Amazon Fresh, and Fresh Direct.  The other, older models can t do instant delivery,  Mehta replied.  And the newer ones don t have anywhere near our coverage and range of data in groceries. So if you want slower delivery and smaller selection, go with them.  Andreessen smiled, savoring the contempt.  At the deal review, Jeff Jordan, who sits on Instacart s board, praised Mehta s progress, while noting concerns about unit economics how he d get to profitability on each delivery. Referring to the venture community s enthusiasm for the round, Jordan went on,  This is an  I missed Uber, I don t want to miss the next one  climate.  Balancing everything, he recommended that the firm put in ten million dollars.  Horowitz argued for a bigger investment. Mehta s moat against competitors  is really fucking deep he already has Whole Foods, monster of monsters. It s the biggest market of all time, incredibly huge.   After other partners argued that the valuation seemed high, Andreessen looked at Horowitz:  Ben, I think you re making an even more provocative point than people understand. It sounds like you re saying this could be an Uber for real.    I think so,  Horowitz said.  What makes unit economics really scary is if you re in a competitive market. He s in a monopoly.   Andreessen said,  We could go to the well, and go in higher.  He beckoned, coaxingly. Horowitz thought it over, then said,  I don t want to override Jeff.  Andreessen, too, seemed content to temper his enthusiasm and to share the round with other firms. (Mehta eventually raised two hundred and twenty million dollars on a valuation of two billion.) He d like to make twenty times the investments the firm does, but every opportunity comes with an opportunity cost, and even $1.5 billion doesn t last forever.  Andrew Golden, the chief investment officer for Princeton University, an L.P. in a16z s last three funds, told me that, when the firm started,  my worry was that Marc is such a big personality he wouldn t necessarily listen to someone who told him he was wearing fewer clothes than he thought. But now my working hypothesis is that Marc is smart enough to know that he ll do better if he doesn t try to win every argument if he doesn t try to go undefeated.   In March, Andreessen and his wife announced the birth of their son, who d been carried to term by a gestational surrogate. They named him John, for Laura s father.  I feel fantastic!  Andreessen told me.  He ll come of age in a world where ten or a hundred times more people will be able to contribute in science and medicine and the arts, a more peaceful and prosperous world.  He added, tongue in cheek,  I m going to teach him how to take over that world!   Andreessen often remarks that, in the blue-collar milieu he came from, no parent wants his or her child to stay blue-collar. His own circumstances have changed dramatically he is now a paper billionaire, though he argues that his net worth depends on how you value a16z so I told him it seemed paradoxical that some of his other babies, such as Instacart and Lyft, make their profits off blue-collar drivers and pickers who must freelance without a safety net to make ends meet. Unsurprisingly, he strongly disagreed:  Maybe there s an alternate way of living, a free-form life where you press the button and get work when you want to.   One afternoon, as we sat at his baronial dining table, he made an agonized but sincere effort to discuss his blue-collar childhood without mentioning his nuclear family.  I really identified with Charles Schulz in the David Michaelis biography of him,  Schulz and Peanuts,    he said. I was struck by the parallels between Andreessen and both  Peanuts in which Charlie Brown has a massive bald head and the parents are kept offstage and its creator. Charles Schulz, who grew up in Minnesota, was socially awkward, hated being embraced, and loathed his mother s Norwegian relatives, a farming family. Andreessen went on,  Ninety-six per cent of the people who grow up like he and I did, in the Midwest, just stay there, but the ones who leave the cartoonist, too, moved to California become intensely interested in the future. In Schulz s last ten years, he really focussed on Rerun, Linus s younger brother the youngest and most optimistic character.   I told Andreessen that this seemed like a tendentious reading of Rerun, a bland character whose two most famous lines are  I ll drink to that  and  My brother is the only one in the family with a blanket, and I don t want to end up like him.  Taken aback, he explained,  He s the youngest, he s the newest, he has the most life in front of him.  Andreessen, as he saw himself, was both an immigrant to the land of opportunity, like the entrepreneurs he preferred to fund, and someone whose childhood was merely an installation phase. He told me,  It wasn t that I felt misunderstood or badly treated; it was that I was so completely different. I wasn t seeking understanding. I wasn t indexing myself against the people around me.   Andreessen reminded me in his formidable achievements and manner, his thickly armored sensitivities and yearnings of Rilke s remark  Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.  When I told him so, he stared back in absolute horror.  Last year, a programmer named Alex Payne wrote an open letter to Andreessen in which he observed,  People are scared of so much wealth and control being in so few hands. Consequently, wherever you and other gatekeepers of capital direct your attention towards robots, 3D printers, biotech, whatever you re going to detect a fearful response as people scramble to determine the impact of your decisions and whims,  which only compound  lingering structural unemployment and an accumulation of capital at the top of the economic pyramid.   Payne addressed his thoughts to Andreessen because Andreessen represents the Valley both in its soaring vision and in its tendency to treat people as a fungible mass. But Andreessen waved away the criticisms as the ravings of  a self-hating software engineer.  When I persisted, he said,  Ordinary people love the iPhone, Facebook, Google Search, Airbnb, and Lyft. It s only the intellectuals who worry.  He raised counter-arguments, then dismissed them: technology would solve any environmental crisis hastened by an expanding economy, and as for the notion that, as he said,    You American imperialist asshole, not everyone wants all that technology well, bullshit! Go to a Chinese village and ask them.  Technology gives us superpowers, makes us smarter, more powerful, happier.  Would the world be a better place if there were fifty Silicon Valleys?  he said.  Obviously, yes. Over the past thirty years, the level of income throughout the developing world is rising, the number of people in poverty is shrinking, health outcomes are improving, birth rates are falling. And it ll be even better in ten years. Pessimism always sounds more sophisticated than optimism it s the Eden-collapse myth over and over again and then you look at G.D.P. per capita worldwide, and it s up and to the right. If this is collapse, let s have more of it!   Global unemployment is rising, too this seems to be the first industrial revolution that wipes out more jobs than it creates. One 2013 paper argues that forty-seven per cent of all American jobs are destined to be automated. Andreessen argues that his firm s entire portfolio is creating jobs, and that such companies as Udacity (which offers low-cost, online  nanodegrees  in programming) and Honor (which aims to provide better and better-paid in-home care for the elderly) bring us closer to a future in which everyone will either be doing more interesting work or be kicking back and painting sunsets. But when I brought up the raft of data suggesting that intra-country inequality is in fact increasing, even as it decreases when averaged across the globe America s wealth gap is the widest it s been since the government began measuring it Andreessen rerouted the conversation, saying that such gaps were  a skills problem,  and that as robots ate the old, boring jobs humanity should simply retool.  My response to Larry Summers, when he says that people are like horses, they have only their manual labor to offer he threw up his hands.  That is such a dark and dim and dystopian view of humanity I can hardly stand it!   One challenge for Andreessen is whether venture itself has a skills problem. If software is truly eating the world, wouldn t venture capital be on the menu? The AngelList platform now allows investors to fund startups online. Its co-founder Naval Ravikant said that  future companies will require more two-hundred-thousand-dollar checks and way fewer guys on Sand Hill Road.  Jeff Fagnan, of Atlas Venture, which is the largest investor in AngelList, said,  Software is already squeezing out other intermediaries travel agents, financial advisers and, at the end of the day, V.C.s are intermediaries. We re all just selling cash.   Andreessen sometimes wonders if Ravikant is onto something. He s asked Horowitz,  What if we re the most evolved dinosaur, and Naval is a bird?  Already, more than half the tech companies that reached a billion-dollar valuation in the past decade were based outside Silicon Valley. And as Andreessen himself wrote in 2007, before he became a V.C.,  Odds are, nothing your V.C. does, no matter how helpful or well-intentioned, is going to tip the balance between success and failure.   He still believes that but he also thinks that a16z can cut a company s time to success in half, and time is money. He also believes that venture will maintain its incumbency because computers can t yet introduce you to just the right engineer or chief information officer at eBay, and machines can t yet come to your office at midnight to future-proof your letter to perturbed customers. Indeed, venture is one of the most human businesses going. Only human beings could have created such a supercollider of contradictions: a font of innovation that pools around conformity; a freedom train that speeds toward monopoly; a promoter of transparency that shrouds its own dealings; a guild that s dedicated to flattening hierarchies, and that rewards its leaders with imperial power.  Naturally, Andreessen had to weigh the counterargument, and consider whether he added any value at all. One Sunday afternoon, as he sat alone at the head of a16z s conference table, he said,  Chris Dixon argues that we re in the magical-products business that we fool ourselves into thinking we re building companies, but it doesn t matter if we don t have the magical products.  And magic could not be summoned, only prepared for.  Over twenty years,  he continued,  our returns are going to come down to two or three or four investments, and the rest of this his gesture took in the building full of art, the devotions of more than a hundred eager souls, even the faux-Moorish rooftops of his competitors down the road is the cost of getting the chance at those investments. There s a sense in which all of this is math you just don t know which Tuesday Mark Zuckerberg is going to walk in.   Yet math was no help with mass psychology.  Even if we could do perfect analysis, we just can t know the future,  he said.  What if Google Ventures had access to all Google searches could you predict hit products? Or perfect access to all of people s conversations or purchases? You still wouldn t know what s going to happen. How is psychohistory going?  he went on, referring to Isaac Asimov s invention, in his  Foundation  novels, of a statistical field that could predict the behavior of civilizations.  Not very fucking good at all! Which, by the way, is part of what makes this job really fun. It s a people business. If we could revise the industry completely, we d just dump all the business plans and focus on people the twenty-three-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs.   He acknowledged, though, that his optimism dims once human beings with their illogic, hidden agendas, and sheer bugginess enter the equation.  We re imperfect people pursuing perfect ideas, and there s tremendous frustration in the gap,  he said.  Writing code, one or two people, that s the Platonic ideal. But when you want to impact the world you need one hundred people, then one thousand, then ten thousand and people have all these people issues.  He examined the problem in silence.  A world of just computers wouldn t work,  he concluded wistfully.  But a world of just people could certainly be improved.     *An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Sequoia Capital.', 'title': 'The Mind of Marc Andreessen', 'date': '2015-05-18 00:00:00', 'path': 'http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man', 'top_image': 'http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/150518_r26512-1200-630-06150519.jpg'},
{'site_name': 'The New Yorker', 'author': '', 'text': 'On a recent Friday morning, a gray-haired woman whom I will call Sally arrived for an appointment with Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and a neuroscientist in the bioengineering department at Stanford University. Sally, now in her sixties, had suffered since childhood from major depression, and had tried the standard treatments: counselling, medication, even electroconvulsive therapy. Nothing helped. She had spent much of her adult life in bed, and had twice attempted suicide. Seven years ago, she was referred to Deisseroth, who uses a combination of unusual medications and brain stimulation to treat autism and severe depression. He accepts only patients for whom all other treatments have failed.  On Deisseroth s advice, a surgeon implanted beneath Sally s left collarbone a small, battery-powered device that regularly sends bursts of electricity into the vagus nerve, which carries the signal into a deep-brain structure that doctors think regulates mood. Originally developed for epilepsy, vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the kind of treatment-resistant depression from which Sally suffers, but the exact reason for its effectiveness is not understood. Sally says that VNS has transformed her life, and that, apart from one period of  going pancake,  she has experienced just a few  dips.   She seemed to be in one of those dips when she took a seat facing Deisseroth.  There s just so much going on,  she said. She had recently suffered a blackout, which her physician thought might be related to a drop in blood pressure, and she had decided, reluctantly, to stop driving until she understood why it had happened. Walking was hard, too; she was scheduled to have knee surgery soon, but it frightened her.   Well, that s a lot to think about,  Deisseroth said. He spoke quietly but with a positive lilt, countering the downward tug of Sally s mood.  Not super-low blood pressure,  he said, scanning her chart.  So that s actually not as concerning as I thought.  Of her decision to suspend driving, he said,  That is smart while it s being figured out.  He added,  You re still socializing, I see which is very important.   She was not mollified.  Mood s been down,  she said.  Just spiralling down.  She mentioned insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.   No suicidal thoughts?  he asked.   Mmm, no,  she said. With sudden urgency, she asked to have the VNS current increased:  Can we please go up to 1.5?  She had been receiving 1.2 milliamps every five minutes for thirty seconds, but was no longer able to feel the effects.   You re tolerating the device very well,  Deisseroth said, after some discussion.  I think we can go up a little.   He handed her a programming wand, which looked a little like a Wii remote. She placed the broad, flat end against her left collarbone, over the implant. Deisseroth took from his desk what appeared to be a smartphone a controller for the wand and thumbed the screen as if tapping out a text. The wand emitted a trilling tone.  I can feel it,  she said.   But you re not coughing,  he said.  That s good.   Problems with the throat are not the only side effects of VNS. Cells outside the targeted treatment area can be roused, affecting cognition. After increasing the voltage, Deisseroth asked Sally that day s date and the counties she d travelled through to get to his office, and to count backward from a hundred by sevens. She performed all the tasks.  Good,  he said.  Flawless cognition.   In the course of the next few minutes, Sally underwent a remarkable change. Her frown disappeared, and she became cheerful, describing the pleasure she d had during the past Christmas holiday and recounting how she had recently watched some YouTube videos of Deisseroth. ( The N.I.H. in June your demeanor behind the podium is, like, Wow! Very strong. ) She was still smiling and talking when the session ended and Deisseroth walked her out to the reception area.  Later, Deisseroth told me that Sally s response to the treatment was good evidence for the efficacy of VNS. But it also provided valuable insight for Deisseroth in his work as a neuroscientist.  When I m sitting in front of a patient and hearing what they re feeling, it concentrates the mind wonderfully,  he says.  It s a source of hypothesis, a source of ideas.   For much of the history of brain research, it has been nearly impossible to accurately test ideas about how the brain works.  When we have the complexity of any biological system but particularly the brain where do you start?  Deisseroth says. Among scientists, he is best known for his development of optogenetics, a technology that renders individual, highly specific brain cells photosensitive and then activates those cells using flashes of light delivered through a fibre-optic wire. Optogenetics has given researchers unprecedented access to the workings of the brain, allowing them not only to observe its precise neural circuitry in lab animals but to control behavior through the direct manipulation of specific cells. Deisseroth, one of the rare neuroscientists who are also practicing psychiatrists, has made mental illness a major focus of his optogenetic research. Other scientists around the world are using the method to investigate some of the most stubborn riddles of neuroscience, including the fundamental question of how the physical brain the nearly hundred billion neurons and their multitudinous connections gives rise to the mind: thought, mood, behavior, emotion.  In the late seventeen-hundreds, the Italian physician Luigi Galvani noticed that static electricity could induce a dead frog s leg to move. For the first time, scientists understood that the nervous system operates under the influence of electrical activity. But it was not until the nineteen-twenties that a Swiss researcher, Walter R. Hess, using implanted wires to stimulate the brains of cats, showed that emotion and behavior also arise from electrical impulses in the brain. By stimulating various brain regions, Hess induced different reactions: for example, a cat could be made to show the defensiveness it might otherwise display when confronted by a dog.  In the nineteen-fifties, a Spanish physiologist at Yale, Jos  Manuel Rodriguez Delgado, conducted experiments with electrodes implanted in the brains of human subjects, using a device he had invented, called a  stimoceiver,  a half-dollar-size electrode operated by remote control. Delgado used the stimoceiver in some twenty-five patients, most of them epileptics and schizophrenics in a Rhode Island mental hospital, and reported that it was  possible to induce a large variety of responses, from motor effects to emotional reactions and intellectual manifestations.  The experiments sparked outrage when they were made public, and Delgado returned to Spain.  The ethical concerns inherent in implanting electrodes in human brains gave way, in the early nineteen-nineties, to the adoption of a wholly noninvasive brain-imaging technology: functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. It was instrumental in bolstering the theory that the brain is divided into discrete regions responsible for different aspects of behavior. The technology uses powerful magnets to detect changes in blood flow in the brain in subjects who are exposed to various stimuli images, sounds, thoughts. Activated regions can be presented on a screen as luminous blobs of color. But fMRI has severe limitations. There is a time lag, and different neuronal events that happen a second or more apart can blur together when the excited area appears onscreen a liability in studying an organ that works at millisecond speed. Nor can fMRI reveal what brain cells are actually doing. The technique registers activity only at the scale of hundreds of thousands of neurons, and a lit-up area might represent any number of neural processes. Given this lack of precision, even some of fMRI s defenders offer faint praise. Nancy Kanwisher, of M.I.T., who has done groundbreaking work to isolate a brain region implicated in face recognition, says,  The real miracle of fMRI is that we ever see anything at all.   To analyze the role of small groups of neurons, scientists have relied on a method not unlike the one that Hess used with his cats: stimulating targeted brain areas, in experimental animals, with thin electrodes. Because electrodes spread current through brain tissue, stimulating activity in unwanted areas, researchers use a drug to suppress neural activity. But the method is cumbersome and time-consuming.  In 2005, Deisseroth published his first paper on what came to be known as optogenetics. Because the technology permits researchers not only to trigger the activity of cells at the speed that the brain actually works but also to target cells in regions, like the amygdala, where there are mixed populations of hundreds of kinds of cells, optogenetics offers a previously unthinkable level of experimental precision. At present, optogenetics can be used only on animals like mice and rats, whose brain functions associated with elemental emotions, like fear and anxiety and reward, are similar to those in humans. But Deisseroth s work with patients like Sally, whose VNS implant allows him to control emotions and behavior, hints at what may one day be possible.  Christof Koch, the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, in Seattle, calls optogenetics one of the most momentous developments in neuroscience in the past hundred and sixty years from the original dye-staining of cell types, in the late nineteenth century, through the use of electrodes, in the fifties and sixties, to the advent of fMRI.  Optogenetics is the fourth wave,  Koch told me.  I can now begin to intervene in the network of the brain in a very delicate, deliberate, and specific way.  Experiments have shed light on many brain functions, including learning, memory, metabolism, hunger, sleep, reward, motivation, fear, smell, and touch.  Optogenetics was a major spur to the Obama Administration s announcement, in 2013, of the BRAIN Initiative, a three-hundred-million-dollar program for developing technologies to treat such neurological ailments as Alzheimer s disease, autism, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Deisseroth was part of the working group that created the Initiative and has vetted grant applications for it.  Deisseroth, who is forty-three, has dark hair that falls into droopy eyes. His voice rarely rises above a murmur, and he comes across as unusually easygoing for someone who developed a transformative neuroscience technology before he was forty. The Stanford neuroscientist Rob Malenka, who oversaw Deisseroth s postdoctoral work, told me that in some ways he underestimated his trainee.  I knew he was really smart. I didn t appreciate that underneath that laid-back, almost surfer-dude kind of persona is this intense creative and intellectual drive, this intense passion for discovery. He almost hides it by his presentation.   Dressed in his usual T-shirt, jeans, and scuffed leather jacket, driving around campus in a dented gray Chevy pickup, Deisseroth could be mistaken for a slightly shambolic creative-writing professor. His initial dream, in fact, was to write. He took writing courses as an undergraduate, and when he was a graduate student in both medicine and neuroscience at Stanford he took a fiction-writing class that met two nights a week at a junior college nearby. He remains an avid reader of fiction and poetry, and he is polishing a book of short stories and essays loosely inspired by Primo Levi s  The Periodic Table.  Deisseroth says that he perceives a connection between scientific inquiry and creative writing:  In writing, it s seeing the truth trying to get to the heart of things with words and images and ideas. And sometimes you have to try to find unusual ways of getting to it.  His fiction bears little resemblance to the technical prose of his neuroscience papers. In a short story describing his first encounter with a schizoaffective patient as a medical intern, Deisseroth wrote that the man s disordered speech was  Finnegans Wake on the psych ward,  a  soliloquy of suffering  that evoked  science and art together, not in parallel but as actually the same idea, fused, as if I were hearing a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem on neurobiology.   One morning, when I was scheduled to meet Deisseroth in Palo Alto, I found him standing at the curb with an elderly motorist who had just added a fresh dent to the back of Deisseroth s truck. The man was agitated. After unhurriedly talking him into a state of calm, then exchanging phone numbers, Deisseroth climbed into the driver s seat, nudged aside some teething rings (he has three children under the age of six, along with an eighteen-year-old son from an earlier marriage), and asked if I d slept well. He seemed to have put the accident entirely behind him even though it had made him late for an important meeting. Many people, I said, would still be discombobulated.  Like those poker players who have a bad hand at the beginning of the night and can t get back on track?  he said, with a smile.  They call it being  on tilt.     Deisseroth seems never to be on tilt. He attributes this partly to his psychiatric training:  Those nights on call where there are five emergencies, you ve got a patient in restraints in the E.R., where they need you immediately, patients up on the psychiatry floor, where someone punched a nurse you develop a little bit of a  just get through it one thing at a time.    His unusual calm has allowed him to compartmentalize competing demands (fatherhood, marriage, neuroscience, literary endeavors, clinical psychiatry, speaking appearances at dozens of conferences a year), so that he can think through complex problems. He told me that, while many people find that walking or jogging shakes ideas loose from the subconscious, he needs to quell all physical activity.  Otherwise, I get this disruption from the motor cortex,  he said.  I have to be totally still.  Ideas come floating up  like a bubble in liquid.  At that point, he goes into an excitable motor state, pacing or scribbling down ideas.  His wife, Michelle Monje a neuroscientist who specializes in pediatric brain cancer has seen the process in action often.  He had this idea of controlling specific brain cells years before actually being able to accomplish it,  she says.  It was so out there. Like,  Yeah, that would be great if it worked.     Deisseroth was born in Boston, but he grew up all around the country as his father, a hematologist-oncologist, followed a series of postings from Boston to Potomac, Houston, and Marin County. His mother taught high-school physics and chemistry; the elder of his two sisters is an orthopedic surgeon, the younger a clinical psychologist. Deisseroth loved reading he recalls riding his bike with a book open on the handlebars, and crashing into parked cars but he was also a classic science kid.  I stopped and looked at bugs and thought about how they were making their decisions,  he says.  And I inspected roadkill with great intensity.   He was in the third grade when he learned that his own brain functioned in an unusual way. A teacher asked the class to choose a poem to recite from memory. Deisseroth opened his reader, looked at a page containing  The Road Not Taken,  and put his hand up. When the teacher explained that he needed to memorize the poem first, he said that he already had, and recited it. The teacher, disbelieving, spent the rest of the class calling on him to quickly glance at a poem and then recite it.  It kind of turned into a circus act,  Deisseroth says.  He remains a preternaturally fast and retentive reader. At a recent conference, he attended a talk by David and Nic Sheff, the father-and-son authors of the addiction memoirs  Beautiful Boy  and  Tweak.  In the course of an hour, while listening to the two men, Deisseroth read both books in their entirety. He does not use the standard techniques of speed-reading but, instead, sees printed pages  in blocks,  he says, and instantly  fills in gaps.  Colleagues suggest that this ability helped Deisseroth to acquire the wide-ranging knowledge necessary for the development of optogenetics, which required a working familiarity with virology, optics, animal behavior, genetics, 3-D imaging, microbiology, materials science, and chemistry.  Deisseroth graduated from high school at sixteen and won a scholarship to Harvard, where he planned to major in creative writing. Instead, he ended up getting a degree in biochemistry, and was admitted, at the age of twenty, to Stanford s combined M.D. and Ph.D. program. Motivated by a desire to better understand human nature, he decided to pursue his Ph.D. in neuroscience.  I didn t come in by asking,  How many bits per second can flow through a pathway?    he says.  I came in maybe from the literature exposure wanting to know where feeling came from. How you could be uplifted by words. How imagination worked.   For his Ph.D., he studied how activity at the synapses of neurons affects the nucleus and influences gene expression, a highly specialized subject but one that is central to an important aspect of being human: memory.  There was all this evidence coming out that changes in gene expression were important for things like long-term-memory storage,  Rob Malenka says.  Karl in what I now understand was his typical way was asking,  What s a big question, a big topic that hasn t been adequately addressed?    Deisseroth s dissertation, which he completed in 1998, spawned papers in the journals Neuron and Nature.  Deisseroth had initially planned to become a neurosurgeon, but he changed his mind after doing a mandatory four-week rotation in psychiatry, where his first patient was the schizoaffective man whose speech he compared, in his short story, to  Finnegans Wake.  Deisseroth prescribed strong antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications, but the man remained too overcome by the disorder to leave the psych ward. Deisseroth was both disappointed and fascinated.  It was the unknown that grabbed me,  he says.  I knew how far we were from a glimmer of understanding.   During his residency, he struggled to reconcile his lab research with the ailing people he talked with on the ward. Malenka recalls,  He d spend all day seeing patients, then rush over to my lab and spend four or five hours running experiments.  He was frustrated that psychiatry s view of the most intractable disorders severe depression, schizophrenia, autism was limited by a fundamental lack of understanding of how the brain works.  A cardiologist can explain a damaged heart muscle to a patient,  Deisseroth told me.  With depression, you cannot say what it really is. People can give drugs of different kinds, put electrodes in and stimulate different parts of the brain and see changed behavior but there is no tissue-level understanding.  He added,  That problem has framed everything. How do we build the tools to keep the tissue intact but let us see and control what s going on?   In 1979, Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the double helix, published an article in Scientific American in which he laid out his hopes for the future of brain science. Neuroscientists were already routinely using electrodes to stimulate the brain, but Crick, noting the method s imprecision, called for a tool that would allow researchers to turn specific neurons on and off, while leaving other cell types untouched. In a later paper, he suggested a way to achieve it:  This seems rather far-fetched, but it is conceivable that molecular biologists could engineer a particular cell type to be sensitive to light.   It turned out that the key to engineering such a cell had already been discovered, in the early seventies, when a German biochemist named Dieter Oesterhelt described the first microbial opsin. Opsins are light-sensitive proteins found in the photoreceptors of the eye, among other places in nature. Oesterhelt s opsin was from a single-celled bacteria that lives in highly saline lakes in Egypt and Kenya, and survives its harsh environment by converting light into energy. Oesterhelt s discovery prompted a wave of research in labs around the world, but no one supposed that genes from a single-celled bacteria could be transported across billions of years of evolution to function in a mammalian brain.  There is so much that is different about microbial cells and our cells,  Deisseroth says.  Their whole inner workings are different how they shuttle proteins from one spot to another, how they store things, package them, send them to the surface of the cell.   In 2002, Gero Miesenb ck, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in New York, became the first researcher to use an opsin to render a brain cell light-sensitive. He used an opsin taken from the retina of a fruit fly. Miesenb ck is considered one of the fathers of optogenetics, and in 2013 he shared a major award, the Brain Prize, with Deisseroth and several others. The fruit-fly opsin required three proteins acting together to get the treated cell to fire. To adapt the experiment to a living animal s brain would mean importing the genetic code for each of the signalling proteins an unwieldy task.  In 2003, a group of German researchers announced the discovery of a new microbial opsin, derived from a green algae that grows in ponds. When introduced into human embryonic kidney cells, the opsin made the cells respond to flashes of blue light. Deisseroth recognized the discovery as being potentially revolutionary. Unlike the fruit-fly opsin, the new opsin channelrhodopsin-2, or ChR2 converted light into electricity in a single step, at virtually the speed of electrical impulses in the brain.  For a few years, Deisseroth had been thinking about using opsins to make neurons in a living animal sensitive to light, but he stresses that he was not the only person who had that idea; he brainstormed with others at Stanford, including a graduate student named Ed Boyden. There was every likelihood that it would be impossible in brain cells, which are far more complex and fragile than the kidney cells that the German team used.  For many scientists, the risk of wasting time and money was too great,  Deisseroth says.  In the summer of 2004, Deisseroth opened his own lab at Stanford, and hired a brilliant Ph.D. student named Feng Zhang, who in his teens had worked in a gene-therapy lab. Zhang seemed like the ideal person to do the delicate work of introducing the pond-scum opsin into a brain cell. The opsin would have to be smuggled into the cell using a virus, but at a concentration that would not kill the neuron. Deisseroth told Zhang that the experiments could be transformative.  He even mentioned something like  This is one of those things that only come around every five or ten years,    Zhang recalls.  Deisseroth s lab isolated a rat neuron in a petri dish, and Zhang chose a benign lentivirus to introduce the opsin into the cell. Deisseroth enlisted Ed Boyden to run tests on the treated cell. When Boyden flashed blue light on the culture, the cell produced strong action potentials the spikes in electrical activity that neurons use to communicate. After a year of experiments, the team had created the world s first reliable technology for generating light-sensitive neurons that signalled at the speed of the brain.  But Deisseroth s excitement was tempered. He says,  It wasn t clear that this would work for what I really cared about not just a toy experiment in a dish but actually controlling behavior in a living animal in a way that could teach us about what the brain is really doing.  Indeed, when the team submitted a paper announcing its results to Science and to Nature, both journals praised the experiment s ingenuity but saw no practical application, and rejected it. When the paper was eventually published, in Nature Neuroscience, in August, 2005, the scientific community was uncertain that the technique could ever be made to work in a living animal.  The doubts only motivated Deisseroth.  I felt a sort of personal need to see what was possible,  he says. Malenka told me that this understates the case considerably:  There s this drive of, like,  You think I m wrong about this, motherfucker? I m going to show you I was right.    Deisseroth began working furiously.  He was getting up at 4 or 5 A.M. and going to bed at one or two,  Monje says. He kept up this schedule for five years, until optogenetic experiments began working smoothly.  There are people who don t need as much sleep,  Monje says.  Karl is not one of those people. He s just that driven.   Deisseroth and his colleagues faced a series of challenges. They struggled to target the opsins to specific brain cells those associated with, say, sleep or memory or anxiety. Finally, they devised a means for attaching small bits of DNA to the opsins, which acted like a password, insuring that they would be produced only in the correct cells. Then they had to figure out a way to deliver flashes of light to regions deep inside the brain, and settled on a fibre-optic wire attached to a laser diode. In late 2005, they began preliminary tests to see if they could control behavior in mice. In the first experiments, on cells in the hypothalamus a region involved in sleep they coaxed the animals to sleep in a dark room, then flashed blue light deep inside their brains. The mice woke sort of.  It was a very subtle change,  Zhang says.  The animal would twitch, then fall back to sleep.  This was hardly the dramatic response they had hoped for.  Deisseroth s next scientific advance was the result of a publicity stunt. As word of what was going on in his lab spread, a Times reporter requested a visit in the summer of 2007.  Karl asked if I could come up with something interesting to show the reporter,  Zhang told me.  I said,  Maybe I can stimulate the motor cortex and cause the mouse to shake, or something.    Deisseroth showed me a video that re-created the experiment. A mouse apparently normal, except for a small tube emerging from the top of its head, where the fibre-optic wire is implanted is filmed from above, standing on its hind legs and sniffing at the side of its enclosure. The instant that a blue glow appears, the mouse begins to run in wide circles to the left. (The fibre-optic wire was shining light on the motor neurons on the right side of the brain, which control movement on the left side of the body.) The instant the light is shut off, the mouse stops running and resumes its sniffing. It s clear that the behavior was not a pain response, since the brain has no pain receptors. By stimulating the motor cortex with light, Deisseroth had turned a freely moving animal into something close to a video-game avatar controlled with a joystick.  That s really the moment we knew that it could drive very, very robust behavior,  Zhang says.  I went to grab Karl, and he said,  This is what we should show the reporter.     The reporter was impressed enough to feature the experiment in her article. But it was another two years before Deisseroth and other researchers demonstrated that optogenetics could be more than what the Times had called a  science-fiction version of stupid pet tricks.  In the spring of 2009, Deisseroth s graduate student Viviana Gradinaru published a paper about using optogenetic manipulation in rodents to define precise neural connections in Parkinson s disease. Shortly after that, Zhang co-authored an article in Science that examined the role that highly specific dopamine neurons play in feelings of reward results that had special significance for drug addiction. Two papers in Nature showed the role of cells in brain activity related to schizophrenia and autism. The papers appeared in quick succession.  That was all people needed,  Deisseroth told me.  The world ran with it.   Scientists wrote to request clones of the opsins to use in their own experiments, and, in the years since, bioengineering subspecialties in the design and development of new opsins have sprung up. Ed Boyden, who left Stanford to launch his own lab, at M.I.T., had already shown that, under flashes of yellow light, a photosensitive protein related to the one that Oesterhelt found in Africa could produce an electrical current that turns off neuronal activity.* By using it in concert with the blue-light opsin, researchers can play neural circuitry like an organ, turning brain activity on and off at the actual speed with which neurons communicate with one another a process, Deisseroth says, that has brought extraordinary control to experiments designed to determine how the brain processes information and drives behavior. By dye-staining cells with proteins that glow fluorescent when neurons fire, researchers can not only  play in  behaviors, by stimulating optogenetically treated brain cells with the fibre-optic light flashes, but also  read out  the circuit activity triggered when a lab animal is put through certain tasks.  Gary Lynch, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, and an expert on memory, says that optogenetics has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience.  The tremendous power is that it lets you take specific populations of neurons that are mixed up with other kinds of neurons and stimulate the type you want to stimulate as in some parts of the amygdala, where neurons relevant to emotion, memory, and sociability intermingle. The problem with previous experiments on the amygdala, Lynch says, is that  when you stimulated it with electrodes and you got effects, you didn t know if it was because of this population or that population of neurons.   Lynch says that he recently began optogenetic experiments on the hippocampus, a deep-brain structure, crucial to narrative memory, that was especially difficult to study with the old methods, because of the myriad neurochemical  inputs  from other parts of the brain.  For years, I and others have been trying to understand what these different inputs do to the hippocampus what are they adding?  he says.  Short of using drugs and electrical stimulation and painfully teasing it out, we find it very, very difficult to get a good answer.  Optogenetics, however, offers an ideal way to pinpoint the neurons in those inputs, turn them on and off, and note the effect that doing so has on memory. The research, he says, could have implications for the tailoring of drugs used to alleviate Alzheimer s.  Deisseroth estimates that optogenetics is now being used in more than a thousand laboratories worldwide, and he takes twenty minutes every Monday morning to sift through written requests for the opsins. It was not until Monje joined her husband at a recent neuroscience conference in Washington, D.C., that she understood the fame that optogenetics had brought him.  People were stopping us at the airport asking to take a picture with him, asking for autographs,  she said.  He can t walk through the conference hall there s a mob. It s like Beatlemania. I realized, I m married to a Beatle. The nerdy Beatle.   Stanford is known for the scarcity of its lab space, but in 2012, as Deisseroth was wooed by rival institutions, the university offered him a dedicated research facility in the hills above Palo Alto. A sleek white structure that he calls the Cracking the Neural Code Building, it once housed a biotech company. The lobby is dominated by a twisting central staircase, like a strand of DNA, linking two floors filled with laboratories, animal surgeries, and offices, where thirty-five students work under Deisseroth s direction.  In one recent experiment, he investigated a major symptom of depression: the inability to take pleasure in formerly enjoyable activities. Mice strongly prefer sugar water to regular water, but after a few weeks of what Deisseroth calls  mild, non-painful stress  they no longer cared whether the water had sugar in it. By examining brain pathways of mice that have been subjected to the stress, Deisseroth traced the specific neural connections that relate to their apathy, isolating the relevant cells and connections. Because we share with rodents many of the protein markers that define those pathways, it is hoped that drugs tailored to those circuits will eliminate the symptoms with an exactitude not previously possible.  That s the direction that clinical psychiatry is going anyway to more of a symptom-focussed treatment,  Deisseroth told me. Many psychiatrists expect that drugs aimed at alleviating the blanket disease of depression like Prozac will increasingly give way to drugs that target precise symptoms, such as anxiety, that occur in multiple disorders.  It matters less which exact disease category someone falls into,  he added.  What matters more is, What are the symptoms and what are the medications that help with those symptoms?   It s possible that optogenetics could be used as a therapeutic tool in humans, and Deisseroth has been given grants aimed at that outcome. With those grants, he has performed experiments to control the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, with the idea of one day developing optogenetics for the treatment of organic brain disorders. He published several papers on the subject in 2010.  A lot of people have followed that up,  he told me, but he has moved on, and is currently focussed on the basic science of the brain, where  the opportunities dwarf everything else in terms of impact.  Some scientists have imagined treatments evocative of Delgado s stimoceiver: implanted L.E.D.s that flash light deep into the brain to quiet anxiety symptoms or, in schizophrenics, hallucinations. Deisseroth warns that such therapies face considerable hurdles, owing to the unknown effects of injecting viruses into the brains of living patients. But, he told me, some clinicians are already looking at possible treatments in the peripheral nervous system the nerves that go to the arms and legs.  If you could turn down the pain fibres without affecting movement or the normal sensations, then we d have a big impact,  he said.  Botond Roska, a neuroscientist in Basel, and Jose-Alain Sahel, an ophthalmologist in Paris, are working with optogenetics to restore sight in the blind. Early tests have been successful in mice and primates.  We also did it in human retinas that had been kept alive from organ donors,  Roska says.  It s another way we know that our vectors will probably work in human subjects.  They hope to run the first human trials in the next year or two.  Deisseroth, meanwhile, also adapts knowledge gained from his optogenetic experiments to use on the patients in his clinical practice. At a recent therapy session, he met with a tall, courtly man in his seventies, who suffers from severe depression associated with Parkinson s disease. I will call him Henry. As Deisseroth worked with Henry, he thought about his studies in mice, which showed a correlation between depression-like states and a dearth of dopamine-producing neurons. A year earlier, he had prescribed for Henry a pill that acts on the dopamine system.  Agents that act just on the dopamine system are very rarely given in depression,  he told me.  But it has been really good for him.  In the session, Henry described a significant improvement in his outlook. Before beginning the drug regimen, he had been unable to summon the will to walk across the room; lately, he had been stretching every morning. He told Deisseroth,  I m not looking backward at things, so I m shaded to the positive.   At the end of the session, Henry described the worst depths of his depression, saying that everything could fill him with hopelessness and dread.  It could be an object,  he said, pointing at the desk.  Like that piece of paper. It bothers me in some unimaginable fashion.   Deisseroth, who had been typing notes on his laptop, looked up.  That s a great phrase,  he said.  Just looking at an object and it making you feel bad. I ve never heard any patient say that. That s a great, crystalline description of how it just touches everything: perception, action, and feeling.   Later, when we were driving back to the lab, I asked Deisseroth about his excited reaction. Did Henry s phrase interest him as a writer, or was it useful to him as a scientist?  That s very usable,  Deisseroth said.  I can think about doing experiments in animals now with that. For example, by using optogenetics to turn down the dopamine neurons, can I make an animal feel aversive toward a formerly neutral object?  He pulled up in front of the building.  I could go in right now and tell a student,  Hey, do that experiment.     One day in early 2010, Deisseroth was in his office, enjoying a few minutes of peace. Optogenetics was finally working as he d hoped. His phone was on mute. He was getting no disruption from his motor cortex.  He had been thinking about one of the most vexing problems in neuroscience: how to create a detailed image of all the brain s neurons and their interconnections. X-rays and other techniques that use light to penetrate the tissues don t work, because of the brain s high volume of fats and water, which cause light to disperse. For years, neuroscientists had resorted to slicing cadaver brains into razor-thin sheets, scanning them, then putting the sections back together, trying to realign the nerve fibres, many of which had been damaged by being cut into layers.  You basically can t do it,  Deisseroth says.  You can only do very local, small-scale anatomy.  Removing the fats and the water was considered impossible, since they make up the  aspic  that holds the delicate network of neurons and axons in place.  Monje recalls her first hint that her husband was working on a new project, which came while they were changing a diaper together. Deisseroth said something about how great it would be if one could render a brain completely transparent. By then, she knew enough not to dismiss such a notion.  I thought, He ll probably figure out how to do it,  she said. In his office, Deisseroth wondered if he could displace the fats and the water with a scaffold that would support the wiring but allow light to penetrate perhaps a hydrogel, a water-based polymer used to support cells in human-tissue repair. He opened a spiral-bound notebook and began to fill pages with words and sketches, ideas for what he called an  endoskeleton  that would  digest away  the fats and the water.  The resulting structure can be studied in unprecedented detail,  he wrote. The idea became CLARITY , an acronym for  Clear Lipid-exchanged Anatomically Rigid Imaging/immunostaining-compatible Tissue hYdrogel.  CLARITY is Deisseroth s second great contribution to neuroscience a method for rendering cadaver brains completely transparent, save for the perfectly intact cells and nerve fibres.  Unlike optogenetics, the idea progressed rapidly to practical use. Deisseroth hired a chemical engineer named Kwanghun Chung, and within a few months they were experimenting with a hydrogel called acrylamide. They injected the acrylamide as a liquid into the tissues, then soaked the brain in warm water, which caused the liquid to turn into a gel. By running a gentle electrical current through the tissues, they drove the fats out, leaving the neural circuitry suspended in the clear hydrogel, and rendering the brain  transparent.   In April, 2013, Deisseroth announced the new technology in Nature; the journal s Web site posted videos of a clarified mouse brain, showing a tangle of fantastically fine cells and nerve fibres, which glowed green against a black background. Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, called it  probably one of the most important advances for doing neuroanatomy in decades.  It has since become a standard tool for scientists and clinicians around the world. Recently published studies using CLARITY have provided fresh insight into the buildup of deposits in the brains of people with Alzheimer s. Monje uses CLARITY to study tumors from the particularly invidious form of pediatric brain cancer that she specializes in. The technology has been adopted as a critical tool for a project, endorsed by the BRAIN Initiative, to make a complete map of a mouse s brain and, perhaps eventually, the human brain an enormous undertaking, on the scale of the Human Genome Project, in which researchers will plot and categorize the nearly hundred billion neurons and the hundred trillion connections among them.  On the day I visited Deisseroth s research building, he walked me through labs where mouse brains were being clarified. Small test tubes, wrapped in foil, stood in racks on motorized, lightly heated platforms that rocked them continuously in a circular motion. He took one of the tubes and peeled away the foil. At the bottom was a small, pinkish, semi-transparent lump floating in cloudy liquid. A fully clarified brain would be nearly invisible to the naked eye.  For decades, researchers have imagined the brain as a soup of neurochemicals whose normal functioning depends on those chemicals remaining in proper balance. Mental illnesses were believed to result from a  chemical imbalance the wrong amount of this or that neurotransmitter in certain synapses. Limitations to that approach were becoming obvious even before the advent of optogenetics and CLARITY .  If you say,  There s some such thing as a serotonin deficiency in depression,  then anything you do that specifically increased serotonin would be an antidepressant,  Deisseroth told me.  But it s not true. So you can t explain things at that level. Likewise for psychosis, or schizophrenia. Some things fit chemical patterns, others don t.   Increasingly, neuroscientists believe that the key to understanding how the brain works lies in its over-all neural circuitry, and the way that widely separated brain regions communicate through the long-range projection of nerve fibres. In this view, mental disorders result from the shorting-out or disruption of the larger circuit wiring of the brain and it is in defining and describing those circuit connections that Deisseroth s innovations promise to be especially helpful.  Christof Koch, at the Allen Institute, likens Deisseroth to Galileo, whose early improvements of the telescope afforded a huge advance in our understanding of the cosmos. Even so, like Galileo s telescope, which opened up the immensity of space, Deisseroth s technologies have helped reveal how little we know about the brain what Koch calls  by far the most complex piece of organized matter in the known universe.   Koch says,  Over the past four hundred years, since the discovery of the telescope, each successive generation of astrophysicists has realized that the universe is still bigger than the previous generation thought. So it is with the brain. Each generation of neuroscientists turns up more complexity, more hidden layers.   Deisseroth told me that he is no closer to understanding the greater mystery of the mind: how a poem or a piece of music can elicit emotions from a mass of neurons and circuits suspended in fats and water.  Those are all incredibly important questions,  he said.  It s just too early to ask them.     *An earlier version of this article misidentified a protein used in a photosensitivity experiment.', 'title': 'The Optogenetics Breakthrough', 'date': '2015-05-18 00:00:00', 'path': 'http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain', 'top_image': 'http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/150518_r26514-1200-630-06150829.jpg'},
{'site_name': 'The New Yorker', 'author': '', 'text': 'It was lunchtime before my afternoon surgery clinic, which meant that I was at my desk, eating a ham-and-cheese sandwich and clicking through medical articles. Among those which caught my eye: a British case report on the first 3-D-printed hip implanted in a human being, a Canadian analysis of the rising volume of emergency-room visits by children who have ingested magnets, and a Colorado study finding that the percentage of fatal motor-vehicle accidents involving marijuana had doubled since its commercial distribution became legal. The one that got me thinking, however, was a study of more than a million Medicare patients. It suggested that a huge proportion had received care that was simply a waste.  The researchers called it  low-value care.  But, really, it was no-value care. They studied how often people received one of twenty-six tests or treatments that scientific and professional organizations have consistently determined to have no benefit or to be outright harmful. Their list included doing an EEG for an uncomplicated headache (EEGs are for diagnosing seizure disorders, not headaches), or doing a CT or MRI scan for low-back pain in patients without any signs of a neurological problem (studies consistently show that scanning such patients adds nothing except cost), or putting a coronary-artery stent in patients with stable cardiac disease (the likelihood of a heart attack or death after five years is unaffected by the stent). In just a single year, the researchers reported, twenty-five to forty-two per cent of Medicare patients received at least one of the twenty-six useless tests and treatments.  Could pointless medical care really be that widespread? Six years ago, I wrote an article for this magazine, titled  The Cost Conundrum,  which explored the problem of unnecessary care in McAllen, Texas, a community with some of the highest per-capita costs for Medicare in the nation. But was McAllen an anomaly or did it represent an emerging norm? In 2010, the Institute of Medicine issued a report stating that waste accounted for thirty per cent of health-care spending, or some seven hundred and fifty billion dollars a year, which was more than our nation s entire budget for K-12 education. The report found that higher prices, administrative expenses, and fraud accounted for almost half of this waste. Bigger than any of those, however, was the amount spent on unnecessary health-care services. Now a far more detailed study confirmed that such waste was pervasive.  I decided to do a crude check. I am a general surgeon with a specialty in tumors of the thyroid and other endocrine organs. In my clinic that afternoon, I saw eight new patients with records complete enough that I could review their past medical history in detail. One saw me about a hernia, one about a fatty lump growing in her arm, one about a hormone-secreting mass in her chest, and five about thyroid cancer.  To my surprise, it appeared that seven of those eight had received unnecessary care. Two of the patients had been given high-cost diagnostic tests of no value. One was sent for an MRI after an ultrasound and a biopsy of a neck lump proved suspicious for thyroid cancer. (An MRI does not image thyroid cancer nearly as well as the ultrasound the patient had already had.) The other received a new, expensive, and, in her circumstances, irrelevant type of genetic testing. A third patient had undergone surgery for a lump that was bothering him, but whatever the surgeon removed it wasn t the lump the patient still had it after the operation. Four patients had undergone inappropriate arthroscopic knee surgery for chronic joint damage. (Arthroscopy can repair certain types of acute tears to the cartilage of the knee. But years of research, including randomized trials, have shown that the operation is of no help for chronic arthritis- or age-related damage.)  Virtually every family in the country, the research indicates, has been subject to overtesting and overtreatment in one form or another. The costs appear to take thousands of dollars out of the paychecks of every household each year. Researchers have come to refer to financial as well as physical  toxicities  of inappropriate care including reduced spending on food, clothing, education, and shelter. Millions of people are receiving drugs that aren t helping them, operations that aren t going to make them better, and scans and tests that do nothing beneficial for them, and often cause harm.  Why does this fact barely seem to register publicly? Well, as a doctor, I am far more concerned about doing too little than doing too much. It s the scan, the test, the operation that I should have done that sticks with me sometimes for years. More than a decade ago, I saw a young woman in the emergency room who had severe pelvic pain. A standard X-ray showed nothing. I examined her and found signs of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is most often caused by sexually transmitted diseases. She insisted that she hadn t been sexually active, but I didn t listen. If I had, I might have ordered a pelvic CT scan or even recommended exploratory surgery to investigate further. We didn t do that until later, by which time the real source of her symptoms, a twisted loop of bowel in her pelvis, had turned gangrenous, requiring surgery. By contrast, I can t remember anyone I sent for an unnecessary CT scan or operated on for questionable reasons a decade ago. There s nothing less memorable.  It is different, however, when I think about my experience as a patient or a family member. I can readily recall a disturbing number of instances of unnecessary care. My mother once fainted in the Kroger s grocery store in our Ohio home town. Emergency workers transported her to a hospital eighty miles away, in Columbus, where doctors did an ultrasound of her carotid arteries and a cardiac catheterization, too, neither of which is recommended as part of the diagnostic workup for someone who s had a fainting episode, and neither of which revealed anything significant. Only then did someone sit down with her and take a proper history; it revealed that she d had dizziness, likely from dehydration and lack of food, which caused her to pass out.  I began asking people if they or their family had been subject to what they thought was unnecessary testing or treatment. Almost everyone had a story to tell. Some were appalling.  My friend Bruce told me what happened when his eighty-two-year-old father developed fainting episodes. His doctors did a carotid ultrasound and a cardiac catheterization. The tests showed severe atherosclerotic blockages in three coronary arteries and both carotid arteries. The news didn t come as a shock. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since the age of seventeen, and in his retirement years was paying the price, with chronic lung disease, an aortic-aneurysm repair at sixty-five, a pacemaker at seventy-four, and kidney failure at seventy-nine, requiring dialysis three days a week. The doctors recommended doing a three-vessel cardiac-bypass operation as soon as possible, followed, a week or two later, by surgery to open up one of his carotid arteries. The father deferred the decision-making to the son, who researched hospitals and found a team with a great reputation and lots of experience. The team told him that the combined procedures posed clear risks to his father for instance, his chance of a stroke would be around fifteen per cent but that the procedures had become very routine, and the doctors were confident that they were far more likely to be successful than not.  It didn t occur to Bruce until later to question what the doctors meant by  successful.  The blockages weren t causing his father s fainting episodes or any other impairments to his life. The operation would not make him feel better. Instead,  success  to the doctors meant reducing his future risk of a stroke. How long would it take for the future benefit to outweigh the immediate risk of surgery? The doctors didn t say, but carotid surgery in a patient like Bruce s father reduces stroke risk by about one percentage point per year. Therefore, it would take fifteen years before the benefit of the operation would exceed the fifteen-per-cent risk of the operation. And he had a life expectancy far shorter than that very likely just two or three years. The potential benefits of the procedures were dwarfed by their risks.  Bruce s father had a stroke during the cardiac surgery.  For me, I m kicking myself,  Bruce now says.  Because I remember who he was before he went into the operating room, and I m thinking, Why did I green-light an eighty-something-year-old, very diseased man to have a major operation like this? I m looking in his eyes and they re like stones. There s no life in his eyes. There s no recognition. He s like the living dead.   A week later, Bruce s father recovered his ability to talk, although much of what he said didn t make sense. But he had at least survived.  We re going to put this one in the win column,  Bruce recalls the surgeon saying.   I said,  Are you fucking kidding me?     His dad had to move into a nursing home.  He was only half there mentally,  Bruce said. Nine months later, his father died. That is what low-value health care can be like.  I m a fan of the radio show  Car Talk  (which ceased taping in 2012 but still airs in reruns), and a regular concern of callers who sought the comic but genuine advice of its repair-shop-owning hosts, Tom and Ray Magliozzi, was whether they were getting snookered by car mechanics into repairs they didn t need.   There s no question we have considerable up-selling in the industry,  Ray told me when I reached him by phone.  Quickie-lube places are the worst for this. I won t name names, but they tend to have the word  lube  in them.  He let out that nyuk-nyuk-nyuk laugh he has.  You can t make money on a $29.95 oil change. So they try to sell you on a lot of stuff. First level, they sell you something you don t need but at least doesn t hurt. Second level, they do some real damage mucking around.   Even reputable professionals with the best intentions tend toward overkill, he said. To illustrate the point, he, too, had a medical story to tell. Eight months earlier, he d torn a meniscus in his knee doing lunges.  Doing lunges is probably something a sixty-five-year-old should not be doing to begin with,  he admitted. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss whether to do physical therapy or surgery.  Very good guy. Very unassuming. I had no reason not to trust the guy. But I also know he s a surgeon. So he s going to present surgery to me.   Sure enough, the surgeon recommended arthroscopic knee surgery.  This is going to fix it,  Ray recalled him saying.  In by nine, out by noon.   Ray went for a second opinion, to a physical therapist, who, of course, favored physical therapy, just as the surgeon favored surgery. Ray chose physical therapy.   How d it turn out?  I asked.   Amazingly well,  he said.  I feel pretty darn good right now.    What did the surgeon say when you told him you weren t going to do the surgery?    He said,  No problem, go to P.T., and when that doesn t work we can schedule the surgery,    Ray recalled.  Who knows? Maybe I will end up having to go back. He wasn t trying to pull the wool over my eyes. But he believed.   What Ray recommended to his car-owning listeners was the approach that he adopted as a patient caveat emptor. He did his research. He made informed choices. He tried to be a virtuous patient.  The virtuous patient is up against long odds, however. One major problem is what economists call information asymmetry. In 1963, Kenneth Arrow, who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, demonstrated the severe disadvantages that buyers have when they know less about a good than the seller does. His prime example was health care. Doctors generally know more about the value of a given medical treatment than patients, who have little ability to determine the quality of the advice they are getting. Doctors, therefore, are in a powerful position. We can recommend care of little or no value because it enhances our incomes, because it s our habit, or because we genuinely but incorrectly believe in it, and patients will tend to follow our recommendations.  Another powerful force toward unnecessary care emerged years after Arrow s paper: the phenomenon of overtesting, which is a by-product of all the new technologies we have for peering into the human body. It has been hard for patients and doctors to recognize that tests and scans can be harmful. Why not take a look and see if anything is abnormal? People are discovering why not. The United States is a country of three hundred million people who annually undergo around fifteen million nuclear medicine scans, a hundred million CT and MRI scans, and almost ten billion laboratory tests. Often, these are fishing expeditions, and since no one is perfectly normal you tend to find a lot of fish. If you look closely and often enough, almost everyone will have a little nodule that can t be completely explained, a lab result that is a bit off, a heart tracing that doesn t look quite right.  Excessive testing is a problem for a number of reasons. For one thing, some diagnostic studies are harmful in themselves we re doing so many CT scans and other forms of imaging that rely on radiation that they are believed to be increasing the population s cancer rates. These direct risks are often greater than we account for.  What s more, the value of any test depends on how likely you are to be having a significant problem in the first place. If you have crushing chest pain and shortness of breath, you start with a high likelihood of having a serious heart condition, and an electrocardiogram has significant value. A heart tracing that doesn t look quite right usually means trouble. But, if you have no signs or symptoms of heart trouble, an electrocardiogram adds no useful information; a heart tracing that doesn t look quite right is mostly noise. Experts recommend against doing electrocardiograms on healthy people, but millions are done each year, anyway.  Resolving the uncertainty of non-normal results can lead to procedures that have costs of their own. You get an EKG. The heart tracing is not completely normal, and a follow-up procedure is recommended. Perhaps it s a twenty-four-hour heart-rhythm monitor or an echocardiogram or a stress test or a cardiac catheterization; perhaps you end up with all of them before everyone is assured that everything is all right. Meanwhile, we ve added thousands of dollars in costs and, sometimes, physical risks, not to mention worry and days of missed work.  Overtesting has also created a new, unanticipated problem: overdiagnosis. This isn t misdiagnosis the erroneous diagnosis of a disease. This is the correct diagnosis of a disease that is never going to bother you in your lifetime. We ve long assumed that if we screen a healthy population for diseases like cancer or coronary-artery disease, and catch those diseases early, we ll be able to treat them before they get dangerously advanced, and save lives in large numbers. But it hasn t turned out that way. For instance, cancer screening with mammography, ultrasound, and blood testing has dramatically increased the detection of breast, thyroid, and prostate cancer during the past quarter century. We re treating hundreds of thousands more people each year for these diseases than we ever have. Yet only a tiny reduction in death, if any, has resulted.  My last patient in clinic that day, Mrs. E., a woman in her fifties, had been found to have a thyroid lump. A surgeon removed it, and a biopsy was done. The lump was benign. But, under the microscope, the pathologist found a pinpoint  microcarcinoma  next to it, just five millimetres in size. Anything with the term  carcinoma  in it is bound to be alarming carcinoma  means cancer, however  micro  it might be. So when the surgeon told Mrs. E. that a cancer had been found in her thyroid, which was not exactly wrong, she believed he d saved her life, which was not exactly right. More than a third of the population turns out to have these tiny cancers in their thyroid, but fewer than one in a hundred thousand people die from thyroid cancer a year. Only the rare microcarcinoma develops the capacity to behave like a dangerous, invasive cancer. (Indeed, some experts argue that we should stop calling them  cancers  at all.) That s why expert guidelines recommend no further treatment when microcarcinomas are found.  Nonetheless, it s difficult to do nothing. The patient s surgeon ordered a series of ultrasounds, every few months, to monitor the remainder of her thyroid. When the imaging revealed another five-millimetre nodule, he recommended removing the rest of her thyroid, out of an abundance of caution. The patient was seeing me only because the surgeon had to cancel her operation, owing to his own medical issues. She simply wanted me to fill in for the job but it was a job, I advised her, that didn t need doing in the first place. The surgery posed a greater risk of causing harm than any microcarcinoma we might find, I explained. There was a risk of vocal-cord paralysis and life-threatening bleeding. Removing the thyroid would require that she take a daily hormone-replacement pill for the rest of her life. We were better off just checking her nodules in a year and acting only if there was significant enlargement.  H. Gilbert Welch, a Dartmouth Medical School professor, is an expert on overdiagnosis, and in his excellent new book,  Less Medicine, More Health,  he explains the phenomenon this way: we ve assumed, he says, that cancers are all like rabbits that you want to catch before they escape the barnyard pen. But some are more like birds the most aggressive cancers have already taken flight before you can discover them, which is why some people still die from cancer, despite early detection. And lots are more like turtles. They aren t going anywhere. Removing them won t make any difference.  We ve learned these lessons the hard way. Over the past two decades, we ve tripled the number of thyroid cancers we detect and remove in the United States, but we haven t reduced the death rate at all. In South Korea, widespread ultrasound screening has led to a fifteen-fold increase in detection of small thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is now the No. 1 cancer diagnosed and treated in that country. But, as Welch points out, the death rate hasn t dropped one iota there, either. (Meanwhile, the number of people with permanent complications from thyroid surgery has skyrocketed.) It s all over-diagnosis. We re just catching turtles.  Every cancer has a different ratio of rabbits, turtles, and birds, which makes the story enormously complicated. A recent review concludes that, depending on the organ involved, anywhere from fifteen to seventy-five per cent of cancers found are indolent tumors turtles that have stopped growing or are growing too slowly to be life-threatening. Cervical and colon cancers are rarely indolent; screening and early treatment have been associated with a notable reduction in deaths from those cancers. Prostate and breast cancers are more like thyroid cancers. Imaging tends to uncover a substantial reservoir of indolent disease and relatively few rabbit-like cancers that are life-threatening but treatable.  We now have a vast and costly health-care industry devoted to finding and responding to turtles. Our ever more sensitive technologies turn up more and more abnormalities cancers, clogged arteries, damaged-looking knees and backs that aren t actually causing problems and never will. And then we doctors try to fix them, even though the result is often more harm than good.  The forces that have led to a global epidemic of overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment are easy to grasp. Doctors get paid for doing more, not less. We re more afraid of doing too little than of doing too much. And patients often feel the same way. They re likely to be grateful for the extra test done in the name of  being thorough and then for the procedure to address what s found. Mrs. E. was such a patient.  Mrs. E. had a turtle. She would have been better off if we d never monitored her thyroid in the first place. But, now that we d found something abnormal, she couldn t imagine just keeping an eye on it. She wanted to take her chances with surgery.  The main way we ve tried to stop unnecessary treatments has been through policing by insurers: they could refuse to pay for anything that looked like inappropriate care, whether it was an emergency-room visit, an MRI scan, or an operation. And it worked. During the nineteen-nineties, the  Mother, may I?  strategy flattened health-care costs. But it also provoked a backlash. Faceless corporate bureaucrats second-guessing medical decisions from afar created an infuriating amount of hassle for physicians and patients trying to orchestrate necessary care and sometimes led to outrageous mistakes. Insurance executives were accused of killing people. Facing a public outcry, they backed off, and health-care costs resumed their climb. A decade and a half later, however, more interesting approaches have emerged.  Consider the case of Michael Taylor. A six-foot-tall, fifty-five-year-old optician from Ogden, Utah, Taylor threw his back out a year ago, while pulling weeds from his lawn. When he tried to straighten up, pain bolted from his lower back through his hips and down both thighs. He made his stooped way up his front-porch steps, into his house, and called his wife, Sandy, at work.   For him to call meant it was really bad,  she said later.  Taylor was a stoic guy who had had back issues for a long time. By his early thirties, he had already undergone two spine operations: the fusion of a vertebra in his neck, which was fractured in a car accident, and the removal of a ruptured disk in his lower back that had damaged a nerve root, causing a foot drop his left foot slapped when he walked. He d had periodic trouble with back spasms ever since. For the most part, he managed them through stretches and exercise. He had been a martial artist since the age of thirteen he d earned a third-degree black belt and retained tremendous flexibility. He could still do splits. Occasionally, if an attack was bad, he saw a pain specialist and got a spinal injection of steroids, which usually worked for a while. This episode, however, was worse than any before.   He could hardly walk,  Sandy said. He tried sleeping in a recliner and waiting out the pain. But it didn t go away. He called his primary-care physician, who ordered an MRI. It showed degenerative disk disease in his lumbar spine a bulge or narrowing of disk space between two of the vertebrae in his lower back. The doctor prescribed muscle relaxants and pain medications, and said that Taylor might need spinal surgery. She referred him to a local neurosurgeon.  Taylor put off making the appointment. He did his lower-back stretches and range-of-motion exercises, and worked on losing weight. These measures helped a little, but he still couldn t sleep in his bed or manage more than a shuffling walk. After four weeks with no improvement, he finally went to see the surgeon, who recommended fusing Taylor s spine where his disk was bulging. Taylor would lose some mobility his days of spinning kicks were over and success was not guaranteed, but the doctor thought that it was the best option.   He said the surgery would be, like, a fifty-fifty thing,  Taylor recalled.  Half of people would see great success. The other half would see little or no difference. And there d be a few who find it makes the pain worse.  There was also the matter of cost. The vision center he managed was in a Walmart superstore, and the co-payments and deductibles with the company insurance plan were substantial. His bills were likely to run past a thousand dollars.  But Taylor had heard about a program that Walmart had launched for employees undergoing spine, heart, or transplant procedures. Employees would have no out-of-pocket costs at all if they got the procedure at one of six chosen  centers of excellence : the Cleveland Clinic; the Mayo Clinic; Virginia Mason Medical Center, in Washington; Scott and White Memorial Hospital, in Texas; Geisinger Medical Center, in Pennsylvania; and Mercy Hospital Springfield, in Missouri. Taylor learned that the designated spine center for his region was Virginia Mason, in Seattle. He used to live in Washington, and the back surgery he d had when he was younger was at the same hospital. He trusted the place, and it had a good reputation. He decided to proceed.  The program connected him to the hospital, and its staff took care of everything from there. They set up his appointments and arranged the travel for him and his wife. All expenses were covered, even their food and hotel costs.   They flew us from Salt Lake City and picked us up at the airport in a town car,  Taylor said. He said he felt like royalty.  Walmart wasn t providing this benefit out of the goodness of its corporate heart, of course. It was hoping that employees would get better surgical results, sure, but also that the company would save money. Spine, heart, and transplant procedures are among the most expensive in medicine, running from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Nationwide, we spend more money on spinal fusions, for instance, than on any other operation thirteen billion dollars in 2011. And if there are complications the costs of the procedure go up further. The medical and disability costs can be enormous, especially if an employee is left permanently unable to return to work. These six centers had notably low complication rates and provided Walmart a fixed, package price.  Two years into the program, an unexpected pattern is emerging: the biggest savings and improvements in care are coming from avoiding procedures that shouldn t be done in the first place. Before the participating hospitals operate, their doctors conduct their own evaluation. And, according to Sally Welborn, the senior vice-president for benefits at Walmart, those doctors are finding that around thirty per cent of the spinal procedures that employees were told they needed are inappropriate. Dr. Charles Nussbaum, until recently the head of neurosurgery at Virginia Mason Medical Center, confirmed that large numbers of the patients sent to his hospital for spine surgery do not meet its criteria.  Michael Taylor was one of those patients. Disk disease like the kind seen on his MRI is exceedingly common. Studies of adults with no back pain find that half or more have degenerative disk disease on imaging. Disk disease is a turtle an abnormality that generally causes no harm. It s different when a diseased disk compresses the spinal cord or nerve root enough to cause specific symptoms, such as pain or weakness along the affected nerve s territory, typically the leg or the arm. In those situations, surgery is proved to be more effective than nonsurgical treatment. For someone without such symptoms, though, there is no evidence that surgery helps to reduce pain or to prevent problems. One study found that between 1997 and 2005 national health-care expenditures for back-pain patients increased by nearly two-thirds, yet population surveys revealed no improvement in the level of back pain reported by patients.  There are gray-zone cases, but Taylor s case was straightforward. Nussbaum said that Taylor s MRI showed no disk abnormality compressing his spinal cord or nerve root. He had no new leg or foot weakness. His pain went down both legs and not past the knee, which didn t fit with disk disease. The symptoms were consistent with muscle spasms or chronic nerve sensitivity resulting from his previous injuries. Fusing Taylor s spine locking two vertebrae together with bolts and screws wouldn t fix these problems. At best, it would stop him from bending where it hurt, but that was like wiring a person s jaw shut because his tooth hurts when he chews. Fusing the spine also increases the load on the disks above and below the level of fusion, making future back problems significantly more likely. And that s if things go well. Nussbaum recommended against the surgery.  This was not what Taylor s wife wanted to hear. Had they come all this way for nothing?  I got kind of angry,  Sandy told me later. She wanted his back problem solved.  He did, too. But he was relieved to hear that he wouldn t have to undergo another back operation. Nussbaum s explanations made sense to him, and he had never liked the idea of having his spine fused. Moreover, unlike most places, the Virginia Mason spine center had him seen not only by a surgeon but also by a rehabilitation-medicine specialist, who suggested a nonsurgical approach: a spinal injection that afternoon, continued back exercises, and a medication specifically for neuropathic pain chronic nerve sensitivity.   Within a couple of weeks, I was literally pain free,  Taylor said. It was six months after his visit to Seattle, and he could do things he hadn t been able to do in decades.   I was just amazed,  Sandy said.  The longer it s been, the better he is.   If an insurer had simply decreed Taylor s back surgery to be unnecessary, and denied coverage, the Taylors would have been outraged. But the worst part is that he would not have got better. It isn t enough to eliminate unnecessary care. It has to be replaced with necessary care. And that is the hidden harm: unnecessary care often crowds out necessary care, particularly when the necessary care is less remunerative. Walmart, of all places, is showing one way to take action against no-value care rewarding the doctors and systems that do a better job and the patients who seek them out.  Six years ago, in  The Cost Conundrum,  I compared McAllen with another Texas border town, El Paso. They had the same demographics the same levels of severe poverty, poor health, illegal immigration but El Paso had half the per-capita Medicare costs and the same or better results. The difference was that McAllen s doctors were ordering more of almost everything diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, procedures. Medicare patients in McAllen received forty per cent more surgery, almost twice as many bladder scopes and heart studies, and two to three times as many pacemakers, cardiac bypass operations, carotid endarterectomies, and coronary stents. Per-capita spending on home-health services was five times higher than in El Paso and more than half of what many American communities spent on all health care. The amount of unnecessary care appeared to be huge.  What explained this? Our piecework payment system rewarding doctors for the quantity of care provided, regardless of the results was a key factor. The system gives ample reward for overtreatment and no reward for eliminating it. But these inducements applied everywhere. Why did McAllen succumb to them more than other medical communities did? Doctors there described a profit-maximizing medical culture. Specialists not only made money from the services they provided; many also owned stakes in home-health-care agencies, surgery and imaging centers, and the local for-profit hospital, which brought them even bigger returns from health-care overuse.  The test of health-care reform, I wrote, was whether McAllen or El Paso would become the new norm. Would McAllen s costs come down or El Paso s go up? Now that it has been five years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I thought I d find out. I returned to the economist Jonathan Skinner, of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, who had provided the earlier analysis of the Medicare data, and worked with him to get a sense of what recent data reveal. As it turns out, the cost of a Medicare patient has flattened across the country, El Paso included. U.S. health-care inflation is the lowest it has been in more than fifty years. Most startling of all, McAllen has been changing its ways. Between 2009 and 2012, its costs dropped almost three thousand dollars per Medicare recipient. Skinner projects the total savings to taxpayers to have reached almost half a billion dollars by the end of 2014. The hope of reform had been to simply  bend the curve.  This was savings on an unprecedented scale.  Skinner showed me the details. In-patient hospital visits dropped by about ten per cent and physicians reduced the mad amounts of home-health-care spending by nearly forty per cent. McAllen s spending on ambulance rides previously the highest in the country dropped by almost forty per cent, too.  I followed up with doctors there to find out how this had happened. I started with Lester Dyke, a cardiac surgeon who was one of many doctors troubled by what they were seeing, but the only one to let me quote him by name in my McAllen piece. ( Medicine has become a pig trough here,  he had told me.  We took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen. ) After it was published, television crews descended on the town. Texas newspapers did follow-up investigations.   The reaction here was fierce, just a tremendous amount of finger-pointing and yelling and screaming,  Dyke recently told me. The piece infuriated the local medical community, which felt unfairly singled out. And Dyke paid a steep price:  I became persona non grata overnight.  Colleagues said that he would be to blame if they lost money. Cardiologists stopped sending him patients.  My cases went down by ninety per cent,  he told me. He had to give up his practice at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, the for-profit hospital, after it became clear that he wasn t welcome there, but he was able to continue doing some surgery at two other hospitals. When I talked to Dyke in the first months afterward, he d sounded low. The few friends who voiced support didn t want to be seen in public with him. He thought he might be forced to retire.  Yet he insisted that he had no regrets. Two of his children went into medicine, and in a medical-ethics class his son was assigned the article. The professor asked whether he was related to the Dr. Dyke quoted in it.   Yes, I am,  he said proudly.  That s my crazy dad.    I don t think you often get a chance in life to stand up to all the badness,  Dyke told me.  With time, the anger of colleagues subsided. Many of them resumed sending him patients. Within a couple of years, he was back to an annual caseload of three hundred open-heart operations. Meanwhile, it got harder for McAllen physicians to ignore the evidence about unnecessary care. Several federal prosecutions cracked down on outright fraud. Seven doctors agreed to a twenty-eight-million-dollar settlement for taking illegal kickbacks when they referred their patients to specialty medical services. An ambulance-company owner was indicted for reporting six hundred and twenty-one ambulance rides that allegedly never happened. Four clinic operators were sent to jail for billing more than thirteen thousand visits and procedures under the name of a physician with dementia. The prosecutions involved only a tiny fraction of the medical community. But Dyke thought it led doctors to say to themselves,  Hey, we re under the magnifying glass. We need to make sure we re doing things strictly by the book.   Jose Pe a, an internist, was a board member at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance in 2009. When we spoke recently, he didn t hesitate to tell me the immediate reaction his colleagues had to what I d written.  We hated you,  he said. The story  put us in a spotlight, in a bad way,  but, he added,  in a good way at the same time.  They hadn t known that they were one of the most expensive communities in the country, he maintained. They knew there were problems,  but we did not know the magnitude.  His hospital did its own analysis of the data and reluctantly came to the same conclusion that the article did: inappropriate and unnecessary care was a serious problem.  The major overuse of home-health-care services proved particularly embarrassing.  We didn t know that home health was a thousand dollars a month  for each patient, Pe a said. People in the medical community had never paid attention to how much of it they were ordering or how little of it was really needed. He led monthly staff meetings with more than four hundred local physicians and began encouraging them to be more mindful about signing home-health-care orders. Within a year, home-health-care agencies started going out of business.  But more interesting was how broad and enduring the cost decline has been. E.R. visits, hospital admissions, tests, and procedures all fell from the Texas stratosphere. And, years after the attention and embarrassment had passed, the costs continued to fall. Bad publicity, a few prosecutions, and some stiffened regulatory requirements here and there couldn t explain that. I probed for months, talking to local doctors and poring over data. And I ve come to think that a major reason for the change may be a collection of primary-care doctors who don t even seem to recognize the impact of what they ve been doing.  Armando Osio is a sixty-three-year-old family physician in McAllen. In 2009, when the article came out, he did not own part of an imaging center or sleep-testing center or hospital or any other medical money-making venture. He didn t have any procedures or tests that he made big money from. He was just a primary-care doctor doing what primary-care doctors do seeing patient after patient every twenty to thirty minutes, for about sixty dollars a visit. That s what Medicare paid; private insurance paid more, and Medicaid or the uninsured paid less. He earned nothing like the income of the specialists that I d written about.  Then, later that year, officials at a large medical group called WellMed contacted Osio. They wanted to establish a practice in McAllen, catering to Medicare patients, and asked whether he d join them. WellMed had contracted with Medicare H.M.O. plans to control their costs. Its pitch to clinicians was that, if a doctor improved the quality of care, this would save on costs, and WellMed would share those savings with the doctor in the form of bonuses. That meant Osio would have to see fewer patients, for longer visits, but WellMed assured him that, if he could show measurable quality improvements, he d actually make more money.  Osio was skeptical, but he agreed to see some of WellMed s patients. When he was in training, he d been interested in geriatrics and preventive medicine. In practice, he hadn t had time to use those skills. Now he could. With WellMed s help, Osio brought on a physician assistant and other staff to help with less complex patients. He focussed on the sicker, often poorer patients, and he found that his work became more satisfying. With the bonuses for higher patient satisfaction, reducing hospital admissions, and lowering cardiology costs, his income went up. This was the way he wanted to practice being rewarded for doing right rather than for the disheartening business of churning through more and more people. Within a year, he d switched his practice so that he was seeing almost entirely WellMed patients.  He gave me an example of one. That day, he d seen an elderly man who had taken a bad spill two or three weeks earlier, resulting in a contused kidney and a compression fracture of his lower spine. After a couple of days in the hospital, he d been sent home. But the pain remained unmanageable. He called Osio s office seeking help.  If the man had called five years ago, a receptionist would have told him that the schedule was full for days and sent him to an emergency room. There, he would have waited hours, been seen by someone who didn t know his story, been given a repeat CT or MRI, and then likely have been kept for another hospital stay. Once the doctors were sure that the situation wasn t dangerous, he would finally have been sent home, with pain medicine and instructions to see his primary-care doctor. Cost: a few thousand dollars.  Now when the man called, the receptionist slotted him to see Osio that afternoon. The doctor examined him and, being familiar with his case, determined that he had no worsening signs requiring imaging. He counselled patience and offered reassurance, gave him pain medication, and sent him home, with a plan for his nurse to check on him the next day. Cost: at most, a hundred dollars. And the patient got swifter, better care.  I spoke to Carlos Hernandez, an internist and the president of WellMed. He explained that the medical group was founded twenty-five years ago, in San Antonio, by a geriatrician who believed that what the oldest and sickest most needed in our hyper-specialized medical system was slower, more dedicated primary care.  Our philosophy is that the primary-care physician and patient should become the hub of the entire health-care-delivery system,  Hernandez said. He viewed the primary-care doctor as a kind of contractor for patients, reining in pointless testing, procedures, and emergency-room visits, co rdinating treatment, and helping to find specialists who practice thoughtfully and effectively. Our technology- and specialty-intensive health system has resisted this kind of role, but countries that have higher proportions of general practitioners have better medical outcomes, better patient experiences, and, according to a European study, lower cost growth. WellMed found insurers who saw these advantages and were willing to pay for this model of care. Today, WellMed has more than a hundred clinics, fifteen hundred primary-care doctors, and around a quarter of a million patients across Texas and Florida.  There s a reason that WellMed focussed on these two states. They are among the nation s most expensive states for Medicare and are less well-supplied with primary care. An independent 2011 analysis of the company s Texas clinics found that, although the patient population they drew from tended to be less healthy than the over-all Medicare population (being older and having higher rates of diabetes and chronic lung disease, for instance), their death rates were half of the Texas average.  This last part puzzled me. I had started to recognize how unnecessary care could crowd out necessary care but enough that dedicated primary care could cut death rates in half? That seemed hard to believe. As I learned more about how Dr. Osio s practice had changed, though, I began to grasp how it could happen.  He told me, for instance, about a new patient he d seen, a sixty-five-year-old man with diabetes. His blood-sugar level was dangerously high, at a level that can signify a full-blown diabetic crisis, with severe dehydration, rising acid levels in the blood, and a risk of death. The man didn t look ill, though. His vital signs were normal. Osio ordered a urine test, which confirmed that the man was not in crisis. That was, in a way, a bad sign. It meant that his diabetes was so out of control that his body had developed a tolerance to big spikes in blood sugar. Unchecked, his diabetes would eventually cause something terrible kidney failure, a heart attack, blindness, or the kind of wound-healing problem that leads to amputation.  Previously, Osio would not have had the time or the resources to do much for the man. So he would have sent him to the hospital. The staff there would have done a battery of tests to confirm what Osio already knew that his blood sugar was way too high. They would have admitted him, given him insulin, and brought his blood sugar down to normal. And that would have been about it. The thousands of dollars spent on the hospital admission would have masked a galling reality: no one was addressing the man s core medical problem, which was that he had a chronic and deadly disease that remained dangerously out of control.  But now WellMed gave Osio bonuses if his patients  diabetes was under better control, and helped him to develop a system for achieving this. Osio spent three-quarters of an hour with the man, going over his pill bottles and getting him to explain what he understood about his condition and how to treat it. The man was a blue-collar worker with limited schooling, and Osio discovered that he had some critical misunderstandings. For instance, although he checked his blood-sugar level every day, he wrongly believed that if the level was normal he didn t need to take his medicine. No, Osio told him; his diabetes medication was like his blood-pressure medication he should never skip a dose unless the home measurements were too low.  Osio explained what diabetes is, how dangerous it can be, how insulin works. Then he turned the man over to an office nurse who had taken classes to become certified as a diabetes educator. She spent another forty-five minutes having him practice how to draw up and take his insulin, and how to track his sugar levels in a logbook. She set a plan to call him every other day for a week and then, if necessary, bring him back for another review. This would continue until his disease was demonstrably under control. After that, she d check on him once a month by phone, and Osio would see him every three to four months. The nurse gave him her direct phone number. If he had any problems or questions, she told him,  Ll mame call me.  Step by deliberate step, Osio and his team were replacing unnecessary care with the care that people needed. Since 2009, in Hidalgo County, where McAllen is situated, WellMed has contracted with physicians taking care of around fourteen thousand Medicare patients. According to its data, the local WellMed practices have achieved the same results as WellMed has elsewhere: large reductions in overuse of care and better outcomes for patients. Indeed, for the past two years, the top-ranked primary-care doctor out of WellMed s fifteen hundred according to a wide range of quality measures, such as the percentage of patients with well-controlled blood pressure and diabetes, rates of emergency-room visits and hospital readmissions, and levels of patient satisfaction has been a McAllen physician.  I spoke to that doctor, Omar Gomez. He said that he d set about building a strong team around his patients, and that team included specialists such as cardiologists and surgeons. He encouraged his patients to shift to the ones who, he noticed, didn t subject them to no-value care. He sat with the specialists, and, he said,  I told them,  If my patient needs a cardiac cath by all means, do it. But if they don t, then don t do it. That s the only thing I ask.     The passage of the Affordable Care Act, in 2010, created opportunities for physicians to practice this kind of dedicated care. The law allows any group of physicians with five thousand or more Medicare patients to contract directly with the government as an  accountable-care organization,  and to receive up to sixty per cent of any savings they produce. In McAllen, two primary-care groups, with a total of nearly thirteen thousand patients, formed to take advantage of the deal. One, as it happens, was led by Jose Pe a, the Doctors Hospital at Renaissance internist. Two years later, Medicare reported that Pe a s team had markedly improved control of its patients  diabetes; patients also had dramatically lower emergency-room visits and hospital admissions. And the two McAllen accountable-care organizations together managed to save Medicare a total of twenty-six million dollars. About sixty per cent of that went back to the groups. It wasn t all profit achieving the results had meant installing expensive data-tracking systems and hiring extra staff. But even after overhead doctors in one group took home almost eight hundred thousand dollars each (some of which they shared with their mid-level staff). It was proving to be a very attractive way to practice.  McAllen, in large part because of changes led by primary-care doctors, has gone from a cautionary tale to something more hopeful. Nationwide, the picture is changing almost as fast. Just five years after the passage of health-care reform, twenty per cent of Medicare payments are being made to physicians who have enrolled in alternative-payment programs, whether through accountable-care organizations like those in McAllen or by accepting Walmart-like packaged-price care known as bundled payment for spine surgery, joint surgery, and other high-cost procedures. If government targets are met, these numbers will reach thirty per cent of Medicare payments by 2016. A growing number of businesses are also extending the centers-of-excellence approach to their employees, including Boeing, Kohl s, Lowe s, and PepsiCo. And a nonprofit in California, the Pacific Business Group on Health, now offers to provide a similar network to any health-care purchaser in the country.  Could a backlash arrive and halt the trend? It s a concern. No one has yet invented a payment system that cannot be gamed. If doctors are rewarded for practicing more conservative medicine, some could end up stinting on care. What if Virginia Mason turns away a back-pain patient who should have gone to surgery? What if Dr. Osio fails to send a heart patient to the emergency room when he should have? What if I recommend not operating on a tiny tumor, saying that it is just a turtle, and it turns out to be a rabbit that bounds out of control?  Proponents point out that people can sue if they think they ve been harmed, and doctors  groups can lose their contracts for low-quality scores, which are posted on the Web. But not all quality can be measured. It s possible that we will calibrate things wrongly, and skate past the point where conservative care becomes inadequate care. Then outrage over the billions of dollars in unnecessary stents and surgeries and scans will become outrage over necessary stents and surgeries and scans that were not performed.  Right now, we re so wildly over the boundary line in the other direction that it s hard to see how we could accept leaving health care the way it is. Waste is not just consuming a third of health-care spending; it s costing people s lives. As long as a more thoughtful, more measured style of medicine keeps improving outcomes, change should be easy to cheer for. Still, when it s your turn to sit across from a doctor, in the white glare of a clinic, with your back aching, or your head throbbing, or a scan showing some small possible abnormality, what are you going to fear more the prospect of doing too little or of doing too much?  Mrs. E., my patient with a five-millimetre thyroid nodule that I recommended leaving alone, feared doing too little. So one morning I took her to the operating room, opened her neck, and, in the course of an hour, removed her thyroid gland from its delicate nest of arteries and veins and critical nerves. Given that the surgery posed a greater likelihood of harm than of benefit, some people would argue that I shouldn t have done it. I took her thyroid out because the idea of tracking a cancer over time filled her with dread, as it does many people. A decade from now, that may change. The idea that we are overdiagnosing and overtreating many diseases, including cancer, will surely become less contentious. That will make it easier to calm people s worries. But the worries cannot be dismissed. Right now, even doctors are still coming to terms with the evidence.  Other people of a more consumerist bent will be troubled not that I gave her the choice but that she paid virtually none of the expenses incurred by it. The nature of her insurance coverage guaranteed that. Her employer had offered her two options. One was a plan with a high deductible and a medical savings account that would have made her pay a substantial portion of the many-thousand-dollar operation. And this might have made her think harder about proceeding (or, at least, encouraged her to find someone cheaper). But, like many people, she didn t want to be in that situation. So she chose the second option, which provided full coverage for cases like this one. She found it difficult enough to weigh her fears of the cancer against her fears of the operation with its risks of life-threatening bleeding and voice damage without having to put finances into the equation.  Two hours after the surgery, Mrs. E. s nurse called me urgently to see her in the recovery room. Her neck was swelling rapidly; she was bleeding. We rushed her back to the operating room and reopened her neck before accumulating blood cut off her airway. A small pumping artery had opened up in a thin band of muscle I d cauterized. I tied the vessel off, washed the blood away, and took her back to the recovery room.  I saw her in my office a few weeks later, and was relieved to see she d suffered no permanent harm. The black and blue of her neck was fading. Her voice was normal. And she hadn t needed the pain medication I d prescribed. I arranged for a blood test to check the level of her thyroid hormone, which she now had to take by pill for the rest of her life. Then I showed her the pathology report. She did have a thyroid cancer, a microcarcinoma about the size of this  O,  with no signs of unusual invasion or spread. I wished we had a better word for this than  cancer because what she had was not a danger to her life, and would almost certainly never have bothered her if it had not been caught on a scan.  All the same, she thanked me profusely for relieving her anxiety. I couldn t help reflect on how that anxiety had been created. The medical system had done what it so often does: performed tests, unnecessarily, to reveal problems that aren t quite problems to then be fixed, unnecessarily, at great expense and no little risk. Meanwhile, we avoid taking adequate care of the biggest problems that people face problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any number of less technologically intensive conditions. An entire health-care system has been devoted to this game. Yet we re finally seeing evidence that the system can change even in the most expensive places for health care in the country.

{'site_name': 'The New Yorker', 'author': '', 'text': 'There is a place in the California desert where a pipe pokes out from a berm made of broken concrete and delivers freshwater to a dying sea. I stood there recently, on a beach of crumbled barnacles, and watched it gush. The sea was the dull blue of a cataract, surrounded by small volcanoes, bubbling mud pots, and ragged, blank mountains used for bombing practice by the Navy and the Marines. The air smelled sweet and vaguely spoiled, like a dog that has got into something on a hot day. When the wind blew, it veiled the mountains in dust and sent puckered waves to meet the frothy white flow from the pipe. The sea, which is called the Salton Sea, is fifteen times bigger than the island of Manhattan and no deeper in most places than a swimming pool. Since 1924, it has been designated as an agricultural sump. In spite of being hyper-saline, and growing saltier all the time, the sea provides habitat to some four hundred and thirty species of birds, some of them endangered, and is one of the last significant wetlands remaining on the migratory path between Alaska and Central America.  In early April, the governor of California ordered the state to conserve a million and a half acre-feet of water in the next nine months, a drastic response to an intensifying four-year drought that has devastated small communities in the north, decimated groundwater supplies in the Central Valley, and made the cities fear for the future. To achieve this savings, Californians are starting to forgo some of the givens of life in modern America: long showers, frequent laundering, toilet-flushing, gardening, golf. It can be hard to visualize a quantity of water. An acre-foot is what it takes to cover an acre to the depth of twelve inches: some three hundred and twenty-five thousand gallons. A million acre-feet is about what the city of Los Angeles uses in two years. A million acre-feet, give or take, is also how much runs off to the Salton Sea each year from the farms of the surrounding Imperial Valley. Salty, spent, and full of selenium and phosphates, the excess water flows down to the sea, where, two hundred and thirty feet below sea level, it evaporates under a blistering sun.  With the state turning brown, the eye is drawn to the bright-green place with the enormous wading pool. A hundred and thirty-five miles east of San Diego, the Imperial Valley has a population of a hundred and eighty thousand, and about five hundred thousand acres of farmland. It was settled as an agricultural area in the early twentieth century, and holds senior rights to water from the Colorado River. California s share of the river was divided in accordance with the doctrine of prior appropriation: whoever first put the water to  beneficial use  could continue to claim it, so long as they did not waste. Of the 4.4 million acre-feet of Colorado River water that California is normally entitled to each year, the Imperial Irrigation District s allowance is 3.1 million. Alfalfa is the most widely planted crop, followed by Bermuda grass and Sudan grass, and flood irrigation is typical. A third of the hay is exported to China and to places lacking the land or the water to grow grass the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Japan where it feeds dairy cows and the cattle that produce Kobe beef.  In 2003, in the largest agricultural-to-urban water transfer in United States history, San Diego County made a deal with the Imperial Valley to buy as much as two hundred thousand acre-feet a year. San Diego County has a growing metropolis, a population of three million, a substantial biotech industry, and virtually no natural water supply. By 2021, the transfer will account for a quarter of its water. The deal gives Imperial billions of dollars to spend on improving efficiency on its farms and in its irrigation infrastructure, which in some places is primitive.  The transfer, mutually beneficial and environmentally necessary, changes the Imperial Valley s relationship to water, bringing it more in line with the realities of long-term drought in a state of thirty-nine million people. There is just one catch. Between the needs of the city and the farmers sits the Salton Sea, which conservation will destroy.  The sea is the linchpin between Colorado River water and urban Southern California,  Michael Cohen, a senior research associate at the Pacific Institute, a water-policy think tank, says. Without the inflows, the sea, already shrinking, will recede dramatically, exposing miles of lake bed loaded with a hundred years  worth of contaminants. Much of the wildlife will disappear poisoned, starved, or driven off. The consequences for people around the region could be dire, too. Before irrigation, the valley was plagued by violent dust storms. With the water gone, the lake bed could emit as much as a hundred tons of fine, caustic dust a day, leading to respiratory illness in the healthy and representing an acute hazard for people with compromised immune systems. No one knows how far that dust can travel on the wind. Mary Nichols, the state s top air-quality official, says,  The nightmare scenario is the pictures we ve all seen of the Dust Bowl that contributed to the formation of California in the first place.   Last year, when Axel Rodriguez was four, he started coughing, a weird cough that sounded like a drum, deep and percussive, and scratchy, as though something inside his chest were trying to claw its way out. The cough would go away for a few days, only to come back stronger.  Axel s mother, Michelle Valdez, is twenty-four, with straight, dark waist-length hair and, behind studious glasses, eyes made up like Cleopatra. She told me recently that the problem had started in August, when the family moved into a new house, a pale-yellow stucco rental in Calexico, about thirty miles south of the Salton Sea.  The houses in this area catch a lot of dirt,  she said from the cars on the heavily trafficked road nearby, from the grass that the landlord insists on mowing, from neighboring Mexicali, the polluted city of a million just across the Mexican border, and, most of all, she said, from the farm fields throughout the valley.  We are in a hole here,  she said.  All the nasty stuff just sits in it.   In September, the cough came and didn t let up for two weeks.  Morning, afternoon, evening, it was cough, cough, cough,  Valdez said. Axel missed school, and his throat got so swollen that he could barely eat. He became a regular at the emergency room. Valdez and her husband, Antonio Marron, plied Axel with cough syrups, drops, Claritin they d been told he had allergies and when those didn t work they contemplated taking him to Mexicali for an herbal cure.  I was very desperate,  Valdez said. The medicines were also putting pressure on their finances. At the time, Marron was making about two hundred dollars a week working at Best Buy; Valdez stayed home, taking care of Axel and his sister, Ana, who is three.  One windy, cold morning in September, Axel told his mother that his chest hurt and he couldn t breathe. Marron covered Axel s face with a blanket and took him to the emergency room again. His lungs were swollen and full of mucus. This time, Marron was told what the family had already begun to suspect: Axel had asthma. At the hospital that day, they met a nurse, Aide Fulton, who runs the Imperial Valley Child Asthma Program. She began to educate them about how to manage a chronic condition in an environment seemingly designed to aggravate it.  Around the same time, Valdez had an episode herself, a tightening in her chest that felt as if someone were squeezing her with a belt. She went to the hospital, and learned that she d lost a quarter of the capacity of her right lung. The diagnosis was chronic obstructed pulmonary disease, a condition associated with lifelong smoking. Valdez, who is not a smoker, has a genetic predisposition to C.O.P.D., but this was her first experience of it. She said,  I told my husband,  I never had an attack until you brought me here!    Not that Marron has been spared. His current job, installing alarm systems, has him in and out of doors all day, and he recently came down with an infection in his lungs.  The valley is eighty per cent Latino and mostly poor. It also has the state s highest rate of asthma-related hospitalization for children. The Imperial Valley Child Asthma Program is the only free asthma-education program in the county, and it operates on an average budget of a hundred and forty-six thousand dollars a year. Fulton told me that in the past few years there has been an increase in referrals from the towns adjacent to the Salton Sea. (At one school, in the seaside town of Calipatria, sixty-five children are ill.)  We already have an unmet need,  she said.  What are we going to do when the Salton Sea dries out?  She is thinking of her clients, and she is thinking of herself. Her husband has asthma, her oldest daughter has asthma, and, after twenty-five years in the valley, she has it, too.  The issue of the sea is a bomb,  she said.  It s a monster coming to get us all.   To the water-minded, the Salton Sea represents a loss of control. For thousands of years, the Colorado River periodically flooded the basin, forming a huge body of water known as Lake Cahuilla, where Native Americans fished and camped. Dry, the land belonged to the Colorado Desert. It was an intimidating wasteland, but it gave people ideas. By the turn of the twentieth century, a company of engineers and real-estate promoters had succeeded in diverting the Colorado into a dry riverbed that once fed Lake Cahuilla. With irrigation, according to a contemporaneous account, the  great expanse of burning waste  was allowed to  blossom into a garden of incomparable beauty and richness to give homes to thousands and sustenance to millions.  The rubric of the valley s first newspaper was  Water Is King Here Is Its Kingdom.   The engineering of the canals and gates, however, was inadequate. Whenever a head gate silted up, a cut was made around it. In 1905, the Colorado overwhelmed one of the cuts and poured full force into the desert, destroying railways and towns. By the time the river was contained again, two years later, there was a huge lake in the basin, and no way to get it out.  As agriculture expanded in the valley, more and more water flowed to the basin. Rich in fertilizers, the water created an algae forest, which in turn fed a tilapia population that was a hundred million strong in the late nineties. Seabirds fish there white and brown pelicans and double-crested cormorants. There are egrets, ibis, ducks and geese, stilts, dowitchers, and avocets; at one point, three and a half million eared grebes were counted. Yuma clapper rails, which are endangered, browse the freshwater marshes created by the farm ditches and the canals.  By the nineteen-sixties, the Salton Sea had become a recreational area, attracting more visitors than Yosemite. The California Department of Fish and Game introduced sport-fishing species like corvina, sargo, and croaker. Tourism flourished, and with it marinas, angling operations, and yacht clubs. Speedboat regattas were held on the sea; people water-skied. An hour from Palm Springs, the sea even drew celebrities. Desi Arnaz came for the golf, and Frank Sinatra hung out at a boat-racing spot called Date Palm Beach.  But the shoreline was unstable, constantly revised depending on the amount of water coming from the Colorado to the farms. Floods in the seventies and eighties inundated many of the properties closest to the sea, causing widespread abandonment. Now, as the water diminishes, the ruins of the heyday are being revealed. Next to the North Shore Beach Yacht Club, which was wrecked by a flood and then rebuilt as a community center, the husk of an old bait shop sits in the shade of a fat date palm. The docks are gone, and the water is distant; pelicans sit on the stranded pylons.  The people who refused to be flushed out or who have reoccupied the shore live an existence so marginal and peculiar that the filmmaker John Waters narrated a documentary about them. Their home, he says, is  where utopia and the apocalypse meet to dance a dirty tango.  These people are waiting for something that will never come: enough water to bring the good times back.  In a small coastal town called Bombay Beach, I stopped at a cinder-block market with bars on the door, looking for something to drink. The town is made up mostly of trailers, which become more dilapidated the closer you get to the beach. In some parts of town, there is no water and no electricity, and the dwellings are lean-tos made from cardboard and plywood.  It s the third flipping world!  a woman working at the market told me. She was in her early fifties, with a tattoo of a chain-link fence and a purple rose around her wrist. She invited me to come back that night to hear her band, Heat Hell and Winter, play fifties covers at the Ski Inn, next door; back in the day, supposedly, you could water-ski right up to the bar. But she warned me to stay away from the beach.  It s spooky after dark,  she said. While we were talking, her husband came up to the counter. (He is Heat, she is Hell. Winter, he said, was at home taking a nap.) He knew just how to fix the water problem. Why not build a pipeline through the mountains and pump in water from the San Diego Bay?  Driving through the farmland of the Imperial Valley inspires awe and indignation. Like a jungle, it seethes: yellow-green Sudan grass; rough, inky sugar beets; alfalfa as bright as a banker s shade; mixed lettuces that grade from light green to violet.  You could not paint a picture that is a better color,  Kay Pricola, the executive director of the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, says.  We are dependent on the water. We exist because of the water.  The unplanted land is grayish, crusted, flocked with crystalline white salt, like a Christmas attraction in a Southern California mall.  There are four hundred and fifty farmers in the Imperial Valley, some of them descendants of the pioneers and many of them quite prosperous. In addition to the forage crops, they grow much of the winter produce eaten in this country. It is hot in the valley, up to a hundred and twenty degrees in the summer months. The farmers tend to travel. Their wives may prefer to spend summers in La Jolla. Half the land is tenant-farmed; in some cases, the owners live elsewhere.  It functions as a plantation,  a local activist told me. Larry Cox, a prominent valley farmer who is the president of the Imperial County Farm Bureau, disputes the characterization. He says that treating farmland as an investment is more like owning an office building in San Diego and hiring someone else to run it.  I asked Al Kalin, a man in his mid-sixties who has farmed by the sea his whole life, what it felt like to have access to a precious resource in such great quantities. He squinted at me.  It s like you have a big gold mine,  he said.  Who s going to try to come and take it away from you next?   For most of the farmers, cheap water is a birthright, and they are loath to part with it at any price. But by the late nineties the situation in the Imperial Valley had begun to look absurd. Historically, California had used more than its allotted 4.4 million acre-feet of water from the Colorado. With growing populations, Arizona and Nevada now wanted their water for themselves. But California s cities were growing, too. Rural, sparsely populated Imperial County evidently had more than enough, however. In order to bring California back down to 4.4 million, Imperial was going to have to share its water with the urban coast.  The 2003 agreement with San Diego was part of a larger deal called the Quantification Settlement Agreement, which also included the transfer of as much as a hundred and three thousand acre-feet to Coachella. The valley stood to benefit handsomely. The deal provided payments to the Imperial Irrigation District (this year, the rate is six hundred and twenty-four dollars per acre-foot), a windfall that would be used partly to improve irrigation systems: installing drip lines and pump-back systems, lining canals and building automated gates. Knowing the chaos that would be caused by a dried-out sea, the architects of the transfer planned for  mitigation water,  achieved by fallowing farmland, to be added to the sea. Landowners with dormant fields would be compensated for each acre-foot of water that they didn t use.  Still, the farmers were offended. Bruce Kuhn, who was the president of the irrigation-district board at the time, described the sentiment in the agricultural community as  How dare you?  He said,  Their grandfathers farmed with all the water they needed. Their fathers farmed with all the water they needed. I m not saying they were spoiled, they just weren t used to being told there were going to be limits.  Some pointed out that more efficient methods wouldn t entirely eliminate the need for flood irrigation, which flushes the salts that accumulate around roots and eventually kill the soil. Outsiders, Kalin told me, have little appreciation of the reasons behind the valley s farming practices.  As the deal was being negotiated, the federal government applied pressure. At one point, it scrutinized Imperial s water use, determined that it was not, in fact, beneficial, and suggested cutting the allotment. The community was enraged. According to  Unquenchable,  a book about water policy in America, a member of the county board of supervisors called it  the great water rape.  Nonetheless, the transfer passed, by one vote. Kuhn voted yes, and lost the next election, as well as lifelong friends and business for his levelling company. (He is back on the board now.)  The state had agreed to devise and fund a restoration plan, and the mitigation water bought some time. In 2007, it released a proposal that envisioned a large wetland at the southern end and, at the northern end, a saltwater lake where people and birds could fish. In between, where the playa was exposed, emissions could be controlled with chemicals or irrigated salt bush. The plan estimated the cost of restoration at nearly nine billion dollars, but the mechanism for financing it was left vague.  By the terms of the agreement with San Diego, the mitigation water expires at the end of 2017; without it, according to projections, the sea will begin to decline precipitously.  We have an  Oh, shit  deadline with 2017,  Keali i Bright, the deputy secretary of legislative affairs at the California Natural Resources Agency, told me. The nine-billion-dollar plan was unrealistic, he said.  It paralyzes us from action.  Instead, the state is spending thirty million dollars for what it calls  no regrets  projects at the sea. Last week, California also moved to form the Salton Sea Task Force, whose goal is to devise a new strategy, and fast. The first step is a meeting next month to  discuss options for governance that provide stable partnerships between the state and stakeholders.   As 2017 approaches, the Imperial Irrigation District is increasingly impatient, and is using San Diego s need of the water as a cudgel. Predictably, the relationship between the Imperial Irrigation District and the San Diego Water Authority has the barely subdued tension of an arranged marriage. (Al Kalin, who has a mischievous sense of humor, told me that he likes to annoy people by wearing a S.D.W.A. cap to Imperial Irrigation District meetings.) In the fall, the irrigation district petitioned the state to honor its obligation to the Salton Sea. The petition sets in motion a process that, I.I.D. leaders suggested to me, could result in their accusing California of breaking its contract thereby nullifying the transfer. No restoration by 2017, no water for San Diego.  The San Diego Water Authority has taken pains to present the problems at the Salton Sea as far outside the scope of the water transfer. But it is a delicate balance. Kevin Kelley, the general manager of I.I.D., told me,  San Diego has a real needle to thread. If you re saying the transfers aren t contributing to the decline of the Salton Sea, and you re at all costs choosing ag-to-urban water transfers over public health, I can see where they d be nervous.  Others find it disingenuous to link the restoration and the transfer. One water expert told me,  You were using water inefficiently. It was your obligation to clean up the inefficiency. It would be unfair for I.I.D. to hold the transfer hostage.   When I visited the San Diego Water Authority, a strenuously Xeriscaped building on the outskirts of the city, the general manager, Maureen Stapleton, described the partnership cautiously.  They have water that has a value, and we have money and we exchange,  she said.  They need money to conserve and improve their system, and we need their water. It s an excellent matching of needs.  As for conditions at the sea, she said,  We can t support and don t believe it s appropriate to be pointing to the Quantification Settlement Agreement.   We talked a bit about the history of the Salton Sea. Dan Denham, her associate, who focusses on Colorado River water, mentioned how remunerative farming is for landowners in the Imperial Valley.   The one per cent are very rich,  he said.   Oh, I think it s more than one per cent,  Stapleton replied, dropping her guard for a second.  Denham said,  Well, most of them live here.  Suddenly, we were in treacherous territory, possibly offensive to the in-laws. The farmers so piqued about giving up their water to San Diego were in fact San Diegans?  Stapleton glanced sharply at Denham, and, when she thought I wasn t looking, mouthed the word  careful.   San Diego, of course, has a huge amount to lose. If the scenario at the Salton Sea seems like doomsday, imagine the San Diego of the near future, deprived of a quarter of its water in the middle of a megadrought.  Every so often, the sea burps, emitting invisible clouds of noxious hydrogen sulfide that can travel as far as Los Angeles. These  turnover  events can kill millions of fish, suddenly enveloping them in the murky, anoxic waters from the bottom of the sea.  If you had a fish tank at home and unplugged the filter and the oxygenator and everything just kind of died, it would turn into this soup,  Chris Schoneman, a biologist who works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, told me.  That s the hydrogen sulfide.   The quality of the water is directly linked to the quantity. Salt and selenium, which occur naturally in the Colorado River, concentrate through evaporation. The less water there is in the sea, the higher these concentrations will get. Salinity has already killed off most of the fish except for tilapia, and soon the sea will be too salty for them, too. Without restoration, Michael Cohen, the Pacific Institute researcher, says, at the end of 2017 the effects of the transfer will hit the sea, reducing the volume by more than sixty per cent, and tripling its salinity in the next decade. Ecologically, he said, these changes will send the sea  over the cliff.   In the absence of fish, brine flies and water boatmen will proliferate, and the fish-eating birds will disappear. Selenium, which causes embryonic deformities, will further impair the already endangered Yuma-clapper-rail population. By the end of the century, there will be no invertebrates left, so no birds of any kind. Salt-tolerant algae and bacteria the pinks and oranges of a vivid sunset will be the primary life form. In  Hazard s Toll,  a report that Cohen and a colleague published in September, he calculates that the price for letting the sea collapse for damages to human health, property values, and agricultural productivity could be as high as seventy billion dollars.  At the refuge, Schoneman is watching the sea devolve at an alarming rate. Snags dead trees from flooded farms that served as great-blue-heron nesting habitat a year ago are now marooned on newly exposed beach. Without the water, what s to stop a raccoon from climbing the tree and stealing the chicks? Several years ago, while conducting an aerial waterfowl survey, Schoneman and his colleague Tom Anderson noticed that an area next to the refuge, called Red Hill Bay, was drying up. They compared the photographs from one year to the next.  Ugh,  Schoneman said.  That kind of kicked us in the head.   At Red Hill Bay, Schoneman and Anderson saw an opportunity for the birds. They applied to the state for a grant to build a complex that will mix the hyper-saline seawater with farm runoff and provide a habitat for shorebirds and waders. The project will break ground this year, and it can be expanded if more money materializes.  A few weeks ago, they drove me out to see the dehydrated bay. We climbed a hill and looked out over a khaki-colored plain, glittering with salt crystals. Schoneman pointed toward the bright-green farm fields that lay beyond the plain.  It s over a mile that way to where the shoreline was ten years ago,  he said.  A short distance down the coast was another feature of the landscape due for renaming: Mullet Island, a small dormant volcano that was partly subsumed when the canal breach formed the Salton Sea, and which once housed a night club called Hell s Kitchen. (The owner is said to have introduced flamingos to the Salton Sea, and there is still one pair left.) Lately, Mullet Island was a nesting ground for double-crested cormorants, but as of now it is not an island at all, just a steep hill with a water view and no birds.  Early one morning, Anderson took me out to see it. Bruce Wilcox, an ecologist who works for the irrigation district, joined us. On a barnacle beach not far from the refuge, we boarded a flat-bottomed boat propelled by an enormous fan. The boat, which was developed for navigating the Everglades, allows Anderson to glide over barely submerged farm equipment and other obstacles. We put on earphones and stopped talking for a bit. The boat zipped past a line of avocets, marbled godwits, and white pelicans, standing knee-deep and staring out to sea. A flock of cormorants, as angular as Escher drawings, spun through the sky.  At the base of Mullet Island, we got out and walked around.  Not too long ago, this was underwater,  Wilcox said. The playa was soft and fine, like cake flour, crusted over in places, bad to breathe. There was a tumbleweed, and a pile of bird bones. Wilcox said that he was working on a plan to run some water back around the base, so the birds could safely nest again another try at beating back the desert.  Returning to the shore, through flurries of birds, I saw a few little splashes I thought might be tilapia. I was thinking about something Anderson had said:  This year, next year, or in ten years, the tilapia won t be able to survive.  The next foraging area is a hundred and twenty miles away, in Mexico. How many of the birds would make it that far without eating?  Looking at the sea can turn the mind poetical. This is the landscape after people, you think. This is the landscape toward the end of the fish, in the last years of the birds, at the beginning of the dust.  Graciela Ruiz, who works at the Imperial Valley Child Asthma Program, wants parents to know: Chihuahuas do not cure asthma. (There is a persistent myth that the dogs absorb the illness; when a family dog dies, the afflicted child is supposed to recover.) This is one of the first things Ruiz told Michelle Valdez, when she made a home visit shortly after Axel got his diagnosis and saw Valdez s Chihuahua, Elvira, sitting on the couch.  I know that!  Valdez told her.  But there was a long list of things that Valdez didn t know, and she credits Ruiz with helping her make the house tolerable for Axel. Now she cleans the floor with vinegar (bleach triggered his attacks), avoids lighting candles, and limits herself to a single house plant. She got rid of her rugs, except for a four-by-six mat in front of the TV, covered the couch with bedsheets, and hung heavy curtains to block the dust from sneaking in through the windows. It was a compromise it keeps her home at constant dusk and an imperfect one. Valdez ran her finger across the sill and held it up: a clump of gray lint was stuck to her fingertip.  I cleaned this three days ago,  she said.  A few minutes earlier, when I arrived at the house, Axel had bounded toward me and excitedly described a recent domestic tragedy. His bunny had eaten some of Elvira s food and died. Lanky and loose, he waved a smartphone at me and said,  My game!,  before disappearing into the kitchen and the blue glow of a Spider-Man cartoon.   Whenever somebody comes over, he just starts talking,  Valdez said.  He likes to be around people anyone who s not his mom, his sister, or his dad.  He has limited opportunities to socialize right now. Because of his asthma, he can t go to the park anymore. Of the past thirty school days, he has missed ten. Valdez has said no to karate and no to soccer. The phone and a tablet she got him are supposed to stop him from getting lonely in the dim rooms.  We re just stuck in the house, practically every day, because he gets so sick when we go out,  she said.  Ana, the three-year-old, came over to where Valdez and I were sitting on the couch. With a top knot and purposeful brows, she proffered a doll and a painted wooden cross. She, too, wanted a playmate. Axel, Valdez said, has stopped playing with her, and begun hitting her instead.   We started seeing a lot of changes in him,  she said.  He got a little gray. Sort of like a Grinch personality. Sometimes I would hug him and he d say,  I don t want you to hug me, I want to go out.    When he threw a fork at her, she took him to Behavioral Health. Now he has another diagnosis: oppositional defiant disorder.  Axel has an inhaler, a nebulizer, and steroids; Valdez, ever watchful, can often avert the fits that used to send them to the emergency room. She is still very protective so worried he will stop breathing in the night that she sleeps beside him, while Ana shares a room with her husband. But Ruiz told her that with medication and proper care Axel will outgrow the worst of his symptoms, and Valdez is hopeful. She has relaxed just enough to focus her concern on Ana.  I m so scared she s getting it,  she said.  Every time she runs, she starts coughing.  Valdez would like to move to San Diego. Whenever they visit there, Axel plays and runs and seems just fine. In the meantime, she told me, the family is moving to a different house, in a cleaner part of town.  Valdez struck me as an extremely engaged and motivated observer of her environment. I asked her what she knew about the Salton Sea. It rang a faint bell. She said that her husband had recently told her it was drying up. She shrugged. Perhaps for her, as for so many others, it was just too big to contemplate. She was a mother thinking about improving her children s lives, but in a larger sense she was a climate refugee. As the water moves around in California, pulling out of agricultural areas and leaving them desolate, there will be more like her. The water goeswhere the people are, and the rest of the people follow. Whatever happens at the sea, Valdez said,  hopefully by then we re not going to be here.
